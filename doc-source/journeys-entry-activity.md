# Set up the journey entry activity<a name="journeys-entry-activity"></a>

After you create and configure the journey, you must configure the *Journey entry* activity\. This activity determines how participants are added to the journey\. There are two ways to add participants to a journey:
+ **When an event occurs** – You can configure the journey so that participants are inserted into a journey dynamically, when specific events occur\. For example, you can use this option to add participants to a journey when they complete a sign\-up workflow\. For more information, see [Add participants when they perform an activity](#journeys-entry-activity-event-triggered)\.
+ **Based on segment membership** – You can insert the members of an existing segment directly into the journey\. The journey can be configured to periodically re\-evaluate the segment to determine if there are new segment members to add\. For more information, see [Add participants from a segment](#journeys-entry-activity-segment-based)\.

**Note**  
*Participant* refers to either a user and their endpoints or individual endpoints, depending on the data\. If the journey entry segment consists of user\-level data \(user\_id\), then the *participant* is the user and all the endpoints associated with the user progress through the journey together\. If the journey entry segment consists of endpoint\-level data \(no user\_id\), then the *participant* is the individual endpoints\.

## Add participants when they perform an activity<a name="journeys-entry-activity-event-triggered"></a>

This event\-triggered journey type adds participants based on a chosen event\. You choose an event, such as music downloads, and then choose the event attributes to further define the journey event\. This might be downloading music from a specific artist\. When a user performs any of the activities described by the event, they become participants in the journey\.

 **To add participants when they perform an activity** 

1. Choose **Add participants when they perform an activity** if it is not already chosen\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/journeys-entry-activity-event.png)

1. For **Events**, choose an event from a list of events or type a new event to add it\. For example, you might want to trigger a journey when a user downloads a particular artist from your music service\. Let's call this event *artist\.download*\. A journey can include only one event\.

   Events can be submitted by using any of the following:
   + The PutEvents API\. See [Events ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-events.html) in the Amazon Pinpoint API Reference
   + AWS Mobile SDK for Android: version 2\.7\.2 or later
   + AWS Mobile SDK for iOS: version 2\.6\.30 or later
**Note**  
If you're using either of the AWS Mobile SDKs you'll be limited to a set of events\. For the list of supported events, see [App events ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/event-streams-data-app.html) in the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide\.

1. \(Optional\) An event attribute is a specific piece of information used to refine an event\. It's composed of an attribute name and a value\. We'll narrow down the *artist\.download* by adding an *artistName* attribute For **Attribute**, choose the attribute from the list\. Since you want to add participants based on specific a specific artist, you'd choose *artistName* as the **Attribute**, and then choose a specific artist for the **Value** – for example, *Bruce Springsteen*\. Your journey event now adds any participants from the *artist\.download* event and the *artistName* is *Bruce Springsteen*\.

   If you want to refine the journey even further, add additional attributes and values by choosing **Add new attribute** for each attribute you want to add\. If an attribute has multiple possible values, you must add each attribute and value pair separately\. For *artist\.download* event you now add in an additional *artistName* attribute, *Alicia Keys*\. Choose **Add new attribute**, again choose *artistName* as the attribute, and then choose *Alicia Keys* for the **Value**\. When you use the same attribute multiple times with different values, Amazon Pinpoint processes the journey attributes using "or" between the values\. Your journey event now adds any participants from the *artist\.download* event, and the *artistName* is either *Bruce Springsteen* or *Alicia Keys*\.

   You can add a combination of attributes with multiple values in addition to attributes with only a single value\. 

1. \(Optional\) Choose an event **Metric**\. This is an event that typically uses a range of numbers, such as a duration or a cost\. After entering the event, choose an **Operator**:
   +  **is equal to** 
   +  **is greater than** 
   +  **is less than** 
   +  **is greater than or equal to** 
   +  **is less than or equal to** 

   Enter the **Value** for the operator\. Only numeric values are supported\. Participants are added based on the metric, operator, and value\. For the *artist\.download* event you might add a *songLength* metric where you add participants when they download any song by either *Bruce Springsteen* or *Alicia Keys* and where the *songLength* is greater than or equal to *500 seconds*\.
**Note**  
You can't use the same metric with multiple values\.

1. \(Optional\) Select the dynamic segment to use for the journey\. You can have only one previously defined segment per journey entry\. In addition, for any endpoint to enter into the journey, that endpoint must be part of the chosen segment\. If you want to build a new segment for this journey, you can build that segment through the Amazon Pinpoint console\. For more information about segments, see [Building segments ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/segments-building.html)\.
**Note**  
Imported segments and dynamic segments based on an imported segment aren't supported\. The dropdown list indicates the type of segment\. While a segment displayed in the dropdown list might indicate it's dynamic, if it's based on an imported segment, you'll get an error

## Add participants from a segment<a name="journeys-entry-activity-segment-based"></a>

For this type of journey, you choose a segment to participate in the journey\. You can optionally configure the Journey entry activity to add new journey participants by periodically searching for new segment members\.

 **To add participants from a segment** 

1. Choose **Add participants from a segment**\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/journeys-entry-activity.png)

1. For **Segments**, choose the segment that you want to add to a journey\.
**Tip**  
You can include only one segment in the** Journey entry** activity\. If you need to add more segments, you can create a new segment that includes all of the segments that you want to add to the journey\. Then, later in the journey, you can use a multivariate split activity to divide journey participants into separate groups based on their segment membership\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Specify how often to add new segment members**, choose how often the segment membership should be evaluated and refreshed\. You can choose **Never**, or you can choose to check on a schedule\. For example, if you choose **Once every 12 hours**, Amazon Pinpoint checks for new segment members every 12 hours\. If new segment members are found during one of these checks, they are added to the journey\. Existing endpoints are also re\-evaluated\. If the **Maximum entries per interval** is greater than 1, then existing endpoints also re\-enter the journey\.

   You can also optionally choose **Refresh on segment update**\. If you enable this feature, new endpoints are added to the journey when the segment is updated\. For this feature to work as expected, you must also choose a refresh interval\.

   The following table describes how changes to segment membership are handled in various situations\.
