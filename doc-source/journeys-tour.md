**Send an email**  
When a participant arrives on a **Send an email** activity, Amazon Pinpoint sends them an email\. When you create a **Send an email** activity, you specify an [email template](message-templates-creating-email.md) to use for the email\. Email templates can include message variables, helping you to create a more personalized experience\.  
**Send a push notification**  
When a participant arrives on a **Send a push notification** activity, Amazon Pinpoint immediately sends a push notification to the user's device\. When you create a **Send a push notification** activity, you'll choose the [push notification template](message-templates-creating-push.md) to use\. Push notification templates can include messages variables, helping you to create a more personalized experience\.

Send your message through one of your custom channels\. For example, you can use custom channels to send messages through third\-party services such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messaenger\. Amazon Pinpoint immediately sends a notification using that service to the user's device using either an AWS Lambda function or a webhook\. For more information on creating custom channels, see [Custom channels in Amazon Pinpoint](channels-custom.md)\.  
**Wait**  
When a participant arrives on a **Wait** activity, they remain on that activity until a certain date or for a specific amount of time\.

**Multivariate split**  
Sends participants down one of up to four paths, based on criteria that you define\. Participants who don't meet any of the criteria proceed down an "Else" path\.  
**Holdout**  
Ends the journey for a specified percentage of participants\.  
**Random split**  
Randomly sends participants down one of up to five paths\.
