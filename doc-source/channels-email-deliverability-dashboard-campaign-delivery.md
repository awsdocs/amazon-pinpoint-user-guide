# Campaign Delivery Metrics<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-campaign-delivery"></a>

The **Campaign delivery metrics** section contains information about inbox placement rates for the email that you sent from your domains\. However, unlike the [Domain reputation](channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain.md) page, the **Campaign delivery metrics** page contains information about specific email campaigns, as opposed to information for entire domains\.

When you choose a domain and a date range, you see a table that contains the following information:
+ **Preview** – A small image that shows the content of the email\. Hover over the image to see a larger preview\.
+ **Last send date** – The date and time when the message was last sent\.
+ **Subject** – The subject line of the email\.
+ **Sender address** – The sender \("From"\) address for the message\.
+ **ESP** – The email provider \(such as Gmail or Yahoo\) that the metrics apply to\.
+ **Inbox rate** – The percentage of emails sent from the campaign that arrived in recipients' inboxes \(as opposed to their junk mail folders\)\.
+ **Open rate** – The percentage of emails sent from the campaign that were opened by their recipients\.

When you choose a campaign in this table, you see a details page for the campaign\. Campaign details pages contain two sections: **Details** and **Sending IP addresses**\.

## Details<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-campaign-delivery-details"></a>

+ **Inbox placement** – The percentage of emails sent from the campaign that arrived in recipients' inboxes \(as opposed to their junk mail folders\)\.
