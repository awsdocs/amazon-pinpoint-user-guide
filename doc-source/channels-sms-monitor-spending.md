# Monitoring SMS and voice spending activity with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-sms-monitor-spending"></a>

This topic provides information about viewing SMS and voice spending metrics in Amazon CloudWatch\. It also explains how to set up a CloudWatch alarm that sends you a notification when your monthly SMS or voice spending exceeds a certain amount\.

If you only want to view your monthly charges for using Amazon Pinpoint, including the amount of money you've spent, you should use the AWS Billing and Cost Management console\. The Billing and Cost Management console provides an estimate of your bill for the current month, and your final charges for previous months\. For more information, see [Viewing your monthly charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/invoice.html) in the *AWS Billing User Guide*\.

## View your monthly SMS and voice spending by using CloudWatch<a name="channels-sms-monitor-spending-metrics"></a>

To quickly determine how much money you've spent sending SMS and voice messages during the current month, you can use the Metrics section of the CloudWatch console\. CloudWatch retains metrics data for 15 months, so you can view real\-time data and analyze historical trends\.

For more information about viewing metrics in CloudWatch, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. On the **All metrics** tab, choose **SMSVoice**\.

## Create an SMS or voice spending alarm by using CloudWatch<a name="channels-sms-monitor-spending-alarms"></a>

In addition to viewing your monthly SMS and voice spending metrics, you can create CloudWatch alarms that notify you when your SMS or voice spending exceeds a certain amount\. You can set up CloudWatch to deliver these notifications to you by sending them to an Amazon SNS topic\.

For more information about creating alarms in CloudWatch, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**To create an SMS or voice spending alarm in CloudWatch**

1. If you haven't already done so, create an Amazon SNS topic and subscribe an endpoint to it\. The endpoint that you subscribe to the topic should be the location where you want to receive spending notifications\. For example, if you want to receive spending notifications by email, subscribe your email address to the Amazon SNS topic\. If you want to receive spending notifications by text message, subscribe an SMS endpoint to the topic\.

   For information about creating and subscribing to topics, see [Getting started with Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/GettingStarted.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. 
**Important**  
Before you create a billing alarm, you must set your AWS Region to US East \(N\. Virginia\)\. Billing metric data is stored in this AWS Region and represents worldwide charges\. You also must enable billing alerts for your account or in the management/payer account \(if you are using consolidated billing\)\. For more information, see [Enabling billing alerts](AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html#turning_on_billing_metrics)\.

   In the navigation pane, under **Alarms**, choose **Billing**\.

1. Next to **Billing alarms**, choose **Create alarm**\.

1. Choose **Select metric**\.

1. On the **All metrics** tab, choose **SMSVoice**, and then choose **Account Metrics**\.

**Note**  
The **TextMessageMonthlySpend** and **VoiceMessageMonthlySpend** metrics don't appear until you send at least one message through Amazon Pinpoint\.

   + Under **Statistic**, choose the statistic or predefined percentile that you want to monitor, or specify a custom percentileâ€”for example, **p99** or **p45**\.
   + Under **Period**, choose the evaluation period for the alarm\. When evaluating the alarm, each period is aggregated into one datapoint\.

1. Choose **Select metric**\. The **Specify metric and conditions** page appears, showing a graph and other information about the metric and statistic for the alarm\.

1. Under **Conditions**, complete the following steps:
   + For **Threshold type**, choose **Static**\.
   + For **Whenever \(**TextMessageMonthlySpend** or **VoiceMessageMonthlySpend**\) is**, specify whether you want the metric to be greater than, greater than or equal to, or equal to the threshold in order to trigger the alarm\. Then, under **than**, enter the threshold value, which is the dollar amount \(in US Dollars\) that you want to trigger the alarm\.

1. Under **Additional configuration**, complete the following steps:
   + For **Datapoints to alarm**, enter the number of evaluation periods \(datapoints\) during which the spending amount must exceed the threshold to trigger the alarm\.
   + For **Missing data treatment**, choose **Treat missing data as ignore \(maintain the alarm state\)**\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Under **Notification**, complete the following steps:
   + For **Whenever this alarm state is**, choose **in Alarm**\. 
   + For **Select an SNS topic**, choose the Amazon SNS topic that you want the alarm notification to be sent to\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Enter a name and, optionally, a description for the alarm, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Under **Preview and create**, review and confirm that the alarm settings are what you want, and then choose **Create alarm**\.
