## Create an SMS Spending Alarm by Using CloudWatch<a name="channels-sms-monitor-spending-alarms"></a>

In addition to viewing your monthly SMS spending metrics, you can create CloudWatch alarms that notify you when your SMS spending exceeds a certain amount\. You can set up CloudWatch to deliver these notifications to you by sending them to an Amazon SNS topic\.

For more information about creating alarms in CloudWatch, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**To create an SMS spending alarm in CloudWatch**

1. If you haven't already done so, create an Amazon SNS topic and subscribe an endpoint to it\. The endpoint that you subscribe to the topic should be the location where you want to receive spending notifications\. For example, if you want to receive spending notifications by email, subscribe your email address to the Amazon SNS topic\. If you want to receive spending notifications by text message, subscribe an SMS endpoint to the topic\.

   For information about creating and subscribing to topics, see [Getting Started with Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/GettingStarted.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.
