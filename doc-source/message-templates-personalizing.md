# Adding personalized content to message templates<a name="message-templates-personalizing"></a>

To deliver dynamic, personalized content in messages that use a template, add *message variables* to the message template\. A *message variable* is a placeholder that refers to a specific attribute that you or Amazon Pinpoint created to store information about your users\. Each attribute typically corresponds to a characteristic of a user, such as a user's first name or the city where they live\. By adding message variables to templates, you can use these attributes to deliver custom content to each recipient of a message that uses a template\.

If a template contains message variables, Amazon Pinpoint replaces each variable with the current, corresponding value of the attribute for each recipient\. It does this each time it sends a message that uses the template\. This means that you can send personalized content to each recipient without creating multiple, customized versions of a message or message template\. You can also feel confident that the message contains the latest information that you have for a recipient\.

For example, if your project is a fitness application for runners and it includes attributes for each user's first name, preferred activity, and personal record, you could use the following text and message variables in a template:

`Hi {{User.UserAttributes.FirstName}}, congratulations on your new {{User.UserAttributes.Activity}} record of {{User.UserAttributes.PersonalRecord}}!`

When you send a message that uses the template, Amazon Pinpoint replaces the variables with the current value of each attribute for each recipient\. The following examples show this\.

**Example 1**  
`Hi Sofia, congratulations on your new half marathon record of 1:42:17!`

**Example 2**  
`Hi Alejandro, congratulations on your new 5K record of 20:52!`

If an attribute value doesn't exist for a recipient, Amazon Pinpoint can replace a variable with a default value that you specify for the variable\. For example, if a user of your fitness application hasn't chosen their preferred activity, you could use `running` as a default value for the `{{User.UserAttributes.Activity}}` variable\. In this case, Amazon Pinpoint replaces the variable as shown in the following examples:

**Example 1**  
`Hi Jane, congratulations on your new running record of 1:42:17!`

**Example 2**  
`Hi John, congratulations on your new running record of 20:52!`

If you don't specify a default value and a value doesn't exist for a recipient, Amazon Pinpoint omits all text for the variable when it sends a message to that recipient\. For example:

`Hi Mary, congratulations on your new record of 20:52!`

As a best practice, we recommend that you specify a default value for each variable that you include in a template\.

## Adding message variables<a name="message-templates-add-variables"></a>

You can add message attributes to a new template you create or to an existing template\. If you add variables to an existing template, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't necessarily apply the changes to messages that use the template and haven't been sent yet, such as campaign messages that are scheduled to be sent at a later time\. This depends on the version of the template that you add variables to and how you configured the messages that use the template\. For more information, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.

**Note**  
In\-app messaging templates do not support the use of message variables\.

**To add a message variable to a message template**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Message templates**\.

1. On the **Message templates** page, do one of the following: 
   + To create a new template and add a message variable to it, choose **Create template**\. Then, on the template page, enter a name for the template and, optionally, a description of the template\.
   + To add a message variable to an existing template, choose the template that you want to add a variable to\. Then, on the template page, choose **Edit**\. Under **Template details**, use the version selector to choose the version of the template that you want to use as a starting point\. If you choose the most recent version, you can save your changes directly to that version of the template\. Otherwise, you can save your changes as a new version of the template\.

1. In the message details section, determine where you want to add a message variable\. You can add a variable to the body of any type of template\. For email and push notification templates, you can also add a variable to the message subject or title\. 

1. In the **Attribute finder**, expand the section for the type of attribute that you want to add a message variable for\. You can choose from the following types of attributes:  
**Standard attributes**  
These are attributes that Amazon Pinpoint creates automatically for any project\. This means that you can use them in messages that you send for any project\. For detailed information about each of these attributes, see [Supported attributes](#message-templates-variables)\.  
To add a variable for a standard attribute, choose the attribute from the list\.  
**Custom attributes**  
These are attributes that you optionally create for individual projects\. Because these attributes might not be available for some of your projects, Amazon Pinpoint might not be able to replace the variable with a value for each and every recipient of a message that uses the template\. To help you avoid this issue, Amazon Pinpoint provides options to help you choose an attribute that exists for specific projects or all of your projects\.  
To add a custom attribute:  

   1. Choose **Custom attributes**, and then choose **Load custom attributes**\. In the window that appears, Amazon Pinpoint lists all the projects you created\. As you choose each project, the attributes common to the selected projects display in the right\-hand navigation pane\. If no attributes display, then there are no common attributes between those projects\. 

   1. Do one of the following:
      + To use all attributes common to the selected projects, choose **Load custom attributes**\.
      + If you want to use a specific attribute from the list, enter any portion of the attribute name in the search field\. Attributes matching the entered text display\. Choose **Load custom attributes** when the attribute you want to use displays\. **Attribute finder** displays the newly added custom attributes\. 
**Note**  
You can neither add common attributes from different sets of projects, nor can you modify the **Custom attributes** section of the **Attribute finder**\. If you need to make changes to custom attributes, choose **X** to clear the **Attribute finder,** and then start again\.

   1. In the **Attribute finder**, choose the attribute that you want to add a variable for\.  
**Recommended attributes**  
These are attributes that you optionally create for your account when you configure Amazon Pinpoint to retrieve personalized recommendations from a recommender model\. For information about using recommender models, see [Machine learning models](ml-models.md)\. You can add variables for this type of attribute to email templates, push notification templates, and SMS templates\. You can't add them to voice templates\.  
To add a variable for a recommended attribute, choose the attribute from the list\. If the **Attribute finder** doesn't list any recommended attributes, you have to first connect the template to a recommender model\.   
To add a recommended attribute:  

   1. Choose **Connect model**\. 

   1. Select the model that you want to retrieve recommendations from when you send messages that use the template\. 

   1. Choose **Connect model**\.


1. When you choose an attribute from the **Attribute finder**, Amazon Pinpoint creates a message variable for the attribute and copies it to your clipboard\. Paste the variable in the location that you want\. If you have a long list of attributes, enter search text to narrow down the list\. Choose **X** to clear the search field\.

   After you paste the variable, Amazon Pinpoint displays it as the name of the associated attribute, enclosed in two sets of curly braces—for example, `{{User.UserAttributes.FirstName}}`\.

1. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each message variable that you want to add\.

1. To specify a default value for a message variable, expand the **Default attribute values** section\. Then, in the list of variables, enter the default value that you want to use for the variable\.
**Note**  
We recommend that you do this for each variable in the template\. Otherwise, Amazon Pinpoint might not be able to send a message that uses the template or the message might display in unexpected or unwanted ways\.

1. When you finish, do one of the following:
   + If you added message variables to a new template, choose **Create**\.
   + If you added message variables to an existing template and you want to save your changes as a new version of the template, choose **Save as new version**\.
   + If you added message variables to an existing template and you want to save your changes as an update to the most recent version of the template, choose **Update version**\. This option is available only if you opened the most recent version of the template in step 3\.

## Supported attributes<a name="message-templates-variables"></a>

Each project can have standard attributes and custom attributes\. Standard attributes are attributes that Amazon Pinpoint creates automatically for any project\. Custom attributes are attributes that you optionally create for a project\. There are three types of custom attributes:
+ **User attributes** – These attributes describe a user—for example, a user's first name, last name, and birth date\. A *user* is an individual who has a unique user ID for a project\.
+ **Endpoint attributes** – These attributes describe a specific endpoint for a user\. An *endpoint* is a destination that you can send messages to—such as an email address, phone number, or mobile device\. Each user can be associated with one or more endpoints\. For example, if you communicate with a user by email, SMS, and phone, the user could be associated with three endpoints—one for the user's email address, another for the user's mobile phone number, and another for the user's home \(landline\) phone number\.
+ **Metric attributes** – These attributes are numeric metrics that your application reports to Amazon Pinpoint for individual endpoints, such as the number of sessions for a mobile app or the number of items left in a cart\.

In addition to custom and standard attributes that you or Amazon Pinpoint creates for your projects, Amazon Pinpoint supports *recommended attributes*\. A *recommended attribute* is an attribute that temporarily stores personalized recommendations for users or endpoints\. Amazon Pinpoint retrieves these recommendations from recommender models that you configure it to use\. Recommended attributes aren't associated with specific projects\. Instead, they're associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account\. For information about using recommender models, see [Machine learning models](ml-models.md)\.

You can use any standard, custom, or recommended attribute in a message variable\. The following table indicates the text that appears in the message variable for each supported attribute, and it describes each attribute\. In the table, *custom\_attribute* indicates text that appears in a variable for a custom attribute\. In those cases, replace *custom\_attribute* with the name of the custom attribute\. For example, if your project stores users' first names in a custom user attribute named `FirstName` and you add a variable for that attribute, the text for the variable is `{{User.UserAttributes.FirstName}}`\.
