# Managing the Amazon Pinpoint voice channel<a name="channels-voice-manage"></a>

You can use the Amazon Pinpoint console to enable the voice channel for a project and to manage settings that apply to the voice channel for your Amazon Pinpoint account\. For example, you can request production access for your account, or request dedicated phone numbers for sending voice messages\.

## Enabling the voice channel<a name="channels-voice-manage-enable"></a>

Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send voice messages, you have to enable the voice channel for one or more projects\. To learn how to create a new project and enable the voice channel for it, see [Setting up the Amazon Pinpoint voice channel](channels-voice-setup.md)\. To enable the voice channel for an existing project, complete the following steps\.

Note that the settings that you choose for the voice channel also apply to the SMS channel for the project\. If you want to send both voice and SMS messages from the project, choose settings that support your goals for both channels\. To learn more, see [Amazon Pinpoint SMS channel](channels-sms.md)\.

**To enable the voice channel for an existing project**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **All projects** page, choose the project that you want to enable the voice channel for\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, choose **SMS and voice**\.

1. On the **SMS and voice** page, next to **SMS settings**, choose **Edit**\.

1. Select **Enable the SMS channel for this project**\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

1. On the **SMS and voice** page, under **Number settings**, refer to the table to determine whether any phone numbers that are already associated with your account can be used to send voice messages\. If there are, the **Voice** column displays **Enabled** next to each phone number that you can use to send voice messages\. If there aren't, [request a phone number for the voice channel](#channels-voice-manage-request-phone-numbers)\.

## Requesting production access<a name="channels-voice-manage-sandbox"></a>

When you first start using the voice channel, your account is in the *sandbox*\. 

To remove these quotas from your account, you can request to have your account removed from the sandbox\. When your account is removed from the sandbox, it has *production access*\.

**Note**  
Before you request production access, you must send at least one voice message from your Amazon Pinpoint account\. You can send a voice message on the [Test Messaging](messages.md) page, or by using the [SendMessages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-messages.html#SendMessages) API\.

**To request production access**

1. On the **Support** menu, choose **Support Center**, as shown in the following image\.

## Requesting phone numbers<a name="channels-voice-manage-request-phone-numbers"></a>

You can use the Amazon Pinpoint console to request and lease phone numbers for sending voice messages\. These phone numbers are referred to as origination numbers\. The type of origination number depends on the destination country and can include Long Code, Toll Free and 10DLC\.

**To request a dedicated long code for sending voice messages**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, choose **SMS and voice**\. 

1. Under **Phone numbers**, choose **Request phone number**\.

1. On the **Define your phone numbers** page, for **Country**, choose the country where your recipients are located\. You can choose only one country at a time, but you can add more countries later if necessary\.
**Tip**  
Not having a phone number from a country where your recipients are located can cause deliverability issues as such deliveries are on best effort basis\.

1. Specify the use case for the phone number\. You can choose one of the following options:
   + **Promotional** – Choose this option for sending marketing messages or messages promoting your business or service\.
   + **Transactional** – Choose this option for sending time\-sensitive messages, such as password resets or transaction alerts\.

   In some countries and regions, the value that you choose may determine the price that you pay for each message that you send\. Transactional messages are optimized for high deliverability, resulting in a higher cost in many countries\. Promotional messages are optimized for cost\-effectiveness\. For more information about SMS pricing, see [Amazon Pinpoint Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/pricing)\.

1. The **Summary** section displays information about the number\. The **Price per month** shows the cost for a single number\.

1. For **Quantity**, choose the quantity of numbers you want to purchase\. You can purchase up to 10 numbers in a single request\. You can purchase additional numbers later\. The **Subtotal** updates to display the total monthly cost for the quantity of phone numbers that you're purchasing\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want to purchase additional phone numbers, choose **Add a country or region**\. 

1. When you're done purchasing phone numbers, choose **Next**\.

1. The **Review and request** page displays the number request details for each destination country\.

1. The **Total cost** displays the total cost for all numbers for all countries you've chosen\.

1. Choose **Request** if you're ready; otherwise, choose **Previous** to go to back and make any changes\. Once you choose **Request** you can no longer make changes\.

1. Typically, the request is approved instantaneously, and a confirmation appears at the top of the page noting that the phone numbers were added successfully\. You can now access those numbers on the Phone numbers tab of the **SMS and voice **page\.

   If the request encounters any errors, an error message displays at the top of the page\. Common errors might be that there were no long codes available for one of your selected countries or an error occurred while trying to provision a long code\. In some cases, your account might require additional review prior to approving your request\. Should this message appear, you'll need to create a support ticket providing further information about your request\.

## Relinquishing phone numbers<a name="channels-voice-manage-remove-phone-numbers"></a>

If you don't need a dedicated phone number \(long code\) for your account anymore, you can relinquish and end your lease for it\. When you relinquish a dedicated long code, we stop charging you for it in your bill for the next calendar month\.

**Important**  
If you relinquish a dedicated long code, you might not be able to obtain the same long code again in the future\.

**To relinquish a dedicated long code**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, choose **SMS and voice**\. 

1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, choose **SMS and voice**\.
