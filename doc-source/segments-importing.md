# Importing segments<a name="segments-importing"></a>

With Amazon Pinpoint, you can define a user segment by importing a file that contains information about the users who belong to the segment\. Importing segments is useful if you define user segments outside of Amazon Pinpoint but you want to engage your users with Amazon Pinpoint campaigns\.

Unlike the dynamic segments that you create with the segment builder in the console, an imported segment is an unchanging set of *endpoints* or *user IDs*: 

**Endpoint**  
A destination that you can send messages to, such as an email address, mobile device identifier, or mobile phone number\. An endpoint definition can include attributes that describe the user or device that you send messages to\. It can also include a user ID\.   
You can define a segment by importing a list of endpoint definitions\. Amazon Pinpoint creates the segment, and it updates any endpoints that you previously added to Amazon Pinpoint with the new information\.

**User ID**  
An ID that represents an individual user in your audience\. This ID must be assigned to one or more endpoints\. For example, if a person uses your app on more than one device, your app could assign that person's user ID to the endpoint for each device\.  
You can define a segment by importing user IDs only if you've added the endpoints that are associated with the user IDs to Amazon Pinpoint\.

An imported segment consists of endpoints, user IDs, or a combination of both\. When you use Amazon Pinpoint to send a message to the segment, the potential destinations include:
+ Each endpoint that you list in the imported file\.
+ Each endpoint that's associated with each user ID that you list in the imported file\.

When you create a new segment, you can use an imported segment as the base segment\. You can then apply filters to the base segment to refine it according to your needs\.

## Imported segment considerations<a name="segments-importing-considerations"></a>

Consider the following factors when you create imported segments:
+ When you create a campaign, you have to choose a segment\. When you choose a dynamic segment, Amazon Pinpoint provides an estimate of the size of that segment\. However, when you choose an imported segment, Amazon Pinpoint can't provide an estimate\.
+ If you create a campaign that sends messages when certain events happen, you can't use imported segments\. Event\-based campaigns can only use dynamic segments\. For more information about creating dynamic segments, see [Building segments](segments-building.md)\.

## Segment files<a name="segments-importing-examples-files"></a>

You define the endpoints or user IDs that belong to your segment in a comma\-separated values \(CSV\) or JSON file\. Then, you import the file into Amazon Pinpoint to create the segment\.

When you import a segment, remember the following:
+ Amazon Pinpoint can't import compressed files\.
+ The files that you import must use UTF\-8 character encoding\.
+ If you're importing new endpoints, the `Address` and `ChannelType` attributes are required\.
+ If you're updating existing endpoints, the `Id` attribute is required for each endpoint that you want to update\.
+ Your endpoint definitions can include only certain attributes\. For a list, see [Supported attributes](#segments-importing-available-attributes)\. In addition, an attribute name has to be 50 or fewer characters\. An attribute value has to be 100 or fewer characters\.

### Example segment files<a name="segments-importing-examples"></a>

The example files in this section are based on the following data:


**Example endpoint attribute values**  

| ChannelType | Address | Location\.Country | Demographic\.Platform | Demographic\.Make | User\.UserId | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| SMS | \+16045550182 | CA | Android | LG | example\-user\-id\-1 | 
| APNS | 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c4d5e6f | US | iOS | Apple | example\-user\-id\-2 | 
| EMAIL | john\.stiles@example\.com | US | iOS | Apple | example\-user\-id\-2 | 
| GCM | 4d5e6f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c | CN | Android | Google | example\-user\-id\-3 | 
| EMAIL | wang\.xiulan@example\.com | CN | Android | OnePlus | example\-user\-id\-3 | 

Each row in this table represents an individual endpoint\. Note that the user IDs `example-user-id-2` and `example-user-id-3` are assigned to two endpoints each\.

**Example File with endpoint definitions**  
You can import endpoints that are defined in a CSV file, as in the following example:  

```
ChannelType,Address,Location.Country,Demographic.Platform,Demographic.Make,User.UserId
SMS,+16045550182,CA,Android,LG,example-user-id-1
APNS,1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c4d5e6f,US,iOS,Apple,example-user-id-2
EMAIL,john.stiles@example.com,US,iOS,Apple,example-user-id-2
GCM,4d5e6f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c,CN,Android,Google,example-user-id-3
EMAIL,wang.xiulan@example.com,CN,Android,OnePlus,example-user-id-3
```
The first line is the header, which contains the endpoint attributes\. For a complete list of possible attributes, see [Supported attributes](#segments-importing-available-attributes)\.  
The subsequent lines define the endpoints by providing values for each attribute in the header\.  
To include a comma or double quote in a value, enclose the value in double quotes, as in `"aaa,bbb"`\.   
The CSV file can't contain line breaks or tabs\. If your file contains data with line breaks or tabs, the data in the file might not be imported, or the import process might fail\.
You can import endpoints that are defined in a newline\-delimited JSON file\. In this format, each line is a complete JSON object that contains an individual endpoint definition, as in the following example:  

```
{"ChannelType":"SMS","Address":"+16045550182","Location":{"Country":"CA"},"Demographic":{"Platform":"Android","Make":"LG"},"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-1"}}
{"ChannelType":"APNS","Address":"1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c4d5e6f","Location":{"Country":"US"},"Demographic":{"Platform":"iOS","Make":"Apple"},"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-2"}}
{"ChannelType":"EMAIL","Address":"john.stiles@example.com","Location":{"Country":"US"},"Demographic":{"Platform":"iOS","Make":"Apple"},"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-2"}}
{"ChannelType":"GCM","Address":"4d5e6f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c","Location":{"Country":"CN"},"Demographic":{"Platform":"Android","Make":"Google"},"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-3"}}
{"ChannelType":"EMAIL","Address":"wang.xiulan@example.com","Location":{"Country":"CN"},"Demographic":{"Platform":"Android","Make":"OnePlus"},"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-3"}}
```
For a complete list of possible attributes, see [Supported attributes](#segments-importing-available-attributes)\.

**Example File with user IDs**  
You can also import user IDs that are listed in a CSV file\. To include a comma or double quote in a value, enclose the value in double quotes, as in "aaa,bbb"\.   
Line breaks are not supported within a value in the CSV\. Multiple user IDs for a single endpoint must be entered on a single line with each ID separated with a space, as in the following example\.  

```
User.UserId
example-user-id-1 example-user-id-2 example-user-id-3
```
The first line is the header, which must contain only the `User.UserId` attribute\.  
The subsequent line lists each user ID that belongs to the segment\.  
As you can see in the example endpoint definitions, the user ID `example-user-id-1` is associated with one endpoint\. The user IDs `example-user-id-2` and `example-user-id-3` are associated with two endpoints each\. Therefore, the segment that's created by importing this file could be used to message up to five endpoints\.
You can also import user IDs that are listed in a newline\-delimited JSON file, as in the following example:  

```
{"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-1"}}
{"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-2"}}
{"User":{"UserId":"example-user-id-3"}}
```
As you can see in the example endpoint definitions, the user ID `example-user-id-1` is associated with one endpoint\. The user IDs `example-user-id-2` and `example-user-id-3` are associated with two endpoints each\. Therefore, the segment that's created by importing this file could be used to message up to five endpoints\.

## Importing a segment<a name="segments-importing-procedure"></a>

There are two ways to import segments into Amazon Pinpoint: you can upload files directly from your computer, or you can import files that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket\.

Uploading files from your computer is generally the easier method of importing segments, especially if you already have the customer data on your computer\. However, you can import only 10 files at a time, and you can only upload files that are smaller than 1 gigabyte \(GB\)\.

If you need to import more than 10 files at one time, or if you need to upload files that are larger than 1 GB, then you should import files from Amazon S3\. The Amazon S3 import option is also useful if you already have processes that send customer data files to Amazon S3 for storage\.

This section includes procedures for importing segments by using both of these methods\.

### Importing a segment by uploading a file from your computer<a name="segments-importing-procedure-direct-import"></a>

You can create segments by uploading up to 10 files directly from your computer\. The files that you upload can be in CSV or JSON format\. You can upload files in any combination of formats\. For example, you can upload one JSON file and three CSV files\.

**To import a segment**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **All projects** page, choose the project that you want to add the segment to\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Segments**\.

1. Choose **Create a segment**\.

1. Under **Create a segment**, choose **Import a segment**\.

1. Under **Import method**, choose **Upload files from your computer**\.

1. Under **Files to import**, select **Choose files**\. Select the file or files that you want to import\.
**Note**  
You can also drag files from your computer's file explorer and drop them directly on the **Drop files here** area\.

1. When you upload files to Amazon Pinpoint, you have to provide a segment name for each file that you import\. Under **Segment names**, enter a segment name for each file that you want to import, as shown in the following image\.  
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/segments-import-names.png)
**Note**  
By default, Amazon Pinpoint provides a segment name that is equal to the name of the imported file, but without the file name extension\. You can change these default values to any name\.  
You can use the same name for multiple segments\. If you do, Amazon Pinpoint creates a distinct segment for each file, and assigns a unique ID to each file\. The creation date is also slightly different for each file that you import\. You can use these factors to distinguish between segments that have the same name\.

1. When you finish, choose **Create segment**\.

### Importing a segment from a file stored in Amazon S3<a name="segments-importing-procedure-s3-import"></a>

Before you use this procedure to import a segment, you first have to create an Amazon S3 bucket and upload your file to that bucket\. You can organize the files for different segments into separate folders\. When Amazon Pinpoint imports the endpoints or user IDs for a segment, it includes the files within all folders and subfolders that belong to the Amazon S3 location you specify\.

For an introduction to creating buckets and uploading objects, see the [Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/)\.

Amazon Pinpoint can import only one file format \(CSV or JSON\) per segment, so the Amazon S3 path that you specify should only contain files of a single type\.

**To import a segment**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **All projects** page, choose the project that you want to add the segment to\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Segments**\.

1. Choose **Create a segment**\.

1. Under **Create a segment**, choose **Import a segment**\.

1. For **Segment name**, enter a name for your segment to make it easy to recognize later\.

1. For **Amazon S3 URL**, enter the location of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the file for your segment\. The address of the bucket must be in the following format:

   ```
   s3://bucket-name/folder-name
   ```

   Amazon Pinpoint imports the files from the path that you specify, and from any subfolders in that path\.

1. For **IAM role**, complete one of the following steps:
   + If you want to have Amazon Pinpoint create a role that allows it to read from an Amazon S3 bucket, choose **Automatically create a role**\. Then, for **IAM role**, enter a name for the role that you're creating\.
   + If you've already created an IAM role that allows Amazon Pinpoint to read from an Amazon S3 bucket, choose **Choose an existing role**\. Then, for **IAM role**, choose a role that contains the appropriate permissions\.

   If you want to create the IAM role yourself, see [IAM role for importing endpoints or segments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-import.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\. After you create the role, specify it in the Amazon Pinpoint console\.

1. Under **What type of file are you importing**, choose either **JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\)** or **Comma\-Separated Values \(CSV\)**, depending on the format the file that you uploaded to Amazon S3\.

1. Choose **Create segment**\.

## Supported attributes<a name="segments-importing-available-attributes"></a>

The table in this section lists and describes the attributes that you can specify in endpoint definitions that you import into Amazon Pinpoint\. If you import segments by using CSV files, the headers in the file should match the names shown in the **Attribute** column\.

For JSON files, a period in the attribute name indicates that the name following the period is an object that's nested in a parent object with a name that's equal to the value preceding the period\. For example, a JSON file that contains the `Demographic.Make` and `Demographic.Model` attributes has the following structure:

```
{
...
"Demographic": {
  ...
  "Make":"Apple",
  "Model":"iPhone"
  ...
  }
...
}
```

The full JSON structure closely resembles the [example endpoint request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-endpoints-endpoint-id.html#apps-application-id-endpoints-endpoint-id-schemas) in the *Amazon Pinpoint API Reference*\. However, not all attributes in the Endpoint request schema are supported when you import segments, including `EndpointStatus` and `EffectiveDate`\.

For a custom field to have multiple values in CSV you need to replicate the header and keep one value per header\. For example:

```
...,User.UserId, User.UserAttributes.new_multi_field,User.UserAttributes.new_multi_field
...,example-user-id-2,test10,test20
```

You can replace attribute names that are shown as `custom_attribute` with any value\. For example, if you want to store users' first and last names in attributes named `FirstName` and `LastName`, you can create custom attributes named `User.UserAttributes.FirstName` and `User.UserAttributes.LastName`, respectively\. An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters\. An attribute value can contain up to 100 characters\. Attribute names are case sensitive\.

In JSON the custom attribute needs to be formatted at `"Attributes":{"Ride":["Bus"]}`\.


| Attribute | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Address | The unique destination address for messages or push notifications that you send to the endpoint—for example, an email address, phone number, or device token\.  If the endpoint address is a phone number, you must specify it in E\.164 format\. For more information about the E\.164 format, see [E\.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) on Wikipedia\.   | 
| Attributes\.custom\_attribute | A custom attribute that describes the endpoint\. You can use this type of attribute as selection criteria when you create a segment\. You can replace custom\_attribute with any value\. | 
| ChannelType | The channel to use when sending messages or push notifications to the endpoint\. For example:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/segments-importing.html) | 
| Demographic\.AppVersion | The version number of the application that's associated with the endpoint\. | 
| Demographic\.Locale | The locale of the endpoint, in the following format: the [ISO 639\-1 alpha\-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code, followed by an underscore \(\_\), followed by an [ISO 3166\-1 alpha\-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) value\. For example, en\_US is the English language locale for the United States\. | 
| Demographic\.Make | The manufacturer of the endpoint device, such as apple or samsung\. | 
| Demographic\.Model | The model name or number of the endpoint device, such as iPhone or SM\-G900F\. | 
| Demographic\.ModelVersion | The model version of the endpoint device\. | 
| Demographic\.Platform | The operating system on the endpoint device, such as ios or android\. | 
| Demographic\.PlatformVersion | The version of the operating system on the endpoint device\. | 
| Demographic\.Timezone | The endpoint's time zone, as a [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) value\. For example, America/Los\_Angeles for Pacific Time \(North America\)\. | 
| EffectiveDate | The date and time when the endpoint was last updated, in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)\. For example, 2019\-08\-23T10:54:35\.220Z for 10:54 AM UTC August 23, 2019\. | 
| Id | A unique identifier for the endpoint\. | 
| Location\.City | The city where the endpoint is located\. | 
| Location\.Country | The two\-character code, in [ISO 3166\-1 alpha\-2 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), for the country or region where the endpoint is located\. For example, US for the United States\. | 
| Location\.Latitude | The latitude coordinate of the endpoint's location, rounded to one decimal place\. | 
| Location\.Longitude | The longitude coordinate of the endpoint's location, rounded to one decimal place\. | 
| Location\.PostalCode | The postal or ZIP code for the area where the endpoint is located\. | 
| Location\.Region | The name of the region, such as a state or province, where the endpoint is located\. | 
| Metrics\.custom\_attribute | A custom numeric metric that your application reports to Amazon Pinpoint for the endpoint—for example, the number of sessions or number of items left in a cart—to use for segmentation purposes\. You can replace custom\_attribute with any value\.These custom values can only be numeric\. Because they're numeric, Amazon Pinpoint can perform arithmetic operations, such as average or sum, on them\. | 
| OptOut | Indicates whether a user opted out of receiving messages and push notifications from you\. Acceptable values are: ALL, the user opted out and doesn't want to receive any messages or push notifications; or, NONE, the user hasn't opted out and wants to receive all messages and push notifications\. | 
| RequestId | The unique identifier for the most recent request to update the endpoint\. | 
| User\.UserAttributes\.custom\_attribute | A custom attribute that describes the user\. You can replace custom\_attribute with any value, such as FirstName or Age\. | 
| User\.UserId | A unique identifier for the user\. | 

You can create as many as 250 custom attributes for endpoints and users in each project\. For more information, see [Amazon Pinpoint quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/quotas.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.
