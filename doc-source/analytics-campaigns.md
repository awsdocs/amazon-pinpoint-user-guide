## Chart descriptions<a name="analytics-campaigns-description"></a>

The **Campaigns** page includes sections that provide aggregated charts and metrics for all the campaigns that were active during the selected time period\.

### Aggregated campaign metrics<a name="analytics-campaigns-description-aggregated"></a>

The **Campaigns** page includes the following charts and metrics, which are aggregated across all the campaigns that were active during the selected time period\.

**Active targetable endpoints**  
Shows the total number of *targetable endpoints*\. A targetable endpoint is an endpoint that currently has a status of *active* for the project and is opted in to receiving messages from you through at least one channel\. This section displays the total number of active targetable endpoints across all channels, and the number of active targetable endpoints for each channel—for example, push notifications, email, and SMS\.

**Campaigns**  
Shows the total number of campaigns that are currently active\. For the selected time period, this section also shows the number of endpoints that received messages from you, and the delivery, open, and opt\-out rates for those messages\. The **Endpoint deliveries** area shows the number of unique endpoints that received messages from the campaigns\.

### Metrics for individual campaigns<a name="analytics-campaigns-description-individual"></a>

When you select a campaign from the table of campaigns, you see charts and metrics that are specific to that campaign\. The charts and metrics that you see depend on the type of channel that the campaign used\.

**Note**

#### Email campaigns<a name="analytics-campaigns-description-individual-email"></a>

When you select a standard campaign that uses the email channel, you see the following charts and metrics\.

**Messages sent**  
The number of messages that were sent\.  
**Messages delivered**  
The number of messages that were delivered to their intended recipients\. Amazon Pinpoint calculates this number by subtracting the number of messages that hard bounced from the number of messages that were sent\.  
**Links clicked**  
 If a message recipient clicks multiple links in a message or clicks the same link more than once, those clicks will be counted as one click if they occur within the same hour\. Multiple clicks taking place at different hours will be counted as separate clicks\. For example, a link is clicked at 8:30 AM and 8:45 AM it will count as one click but if the link is clicked at 8:30 AM and 9:05 AM it will count as two clicks because the hour has changed\.

**Bounce rate**  
The percentage of messages that couldn't be delivered to their intended recipients\.

**Delivery rate**
