# Exporting segments in the Amazon Pinpoint console<a name="segments-exporting"></a>

From the **Segments** page in the Amazon Pinpoint console, you can export an existing segment to a file on your computer\. When you do, Amazon Pinpoint exports all of the information that's associated with the endpoints in the segment to a file\.

This feature is useful if you want to share a list of segment members with somebody else in your organization who doesn't use Amazon Pinpoint\. It's also helpful in situations where you want to modify the segment by using a different application\.

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **All projects** page, choose the project that contains the segment that you want to export\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Segments**\.

1. In the list of segments, choose the segment that you want to export\.

1. At the top of the page, choose **Export**, as shown in the following image\.

1. Amazon Pinpoint creates a new export job, and you see the **Recent exports** tab on the **Segments** page\.

   Note the value in the **Export status** column for the segment that you exported\. When you first create the export job, the status is **In progress**\.

   Wait a few minutes, and then choose the **refresh** \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/refresh-button.png)\) button\. If the status is still **In progress**, wait another minute, and then repeat this step\. Otherwise, if the status is **Complete**, proceed to the next step\.
**Note**  
If a segment requires more than 10 minutes to complete, the export process times out\. If you need to export very large segments, you should use the [CreateExportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-jobs-export.html#CreateExportJob) operation in the Amazon Pinpoint API\.

1. Choose **Download** to save the segment to your computer, as shown in the following image\.
