# Step 1: Create and configure a project<a name="gettingstarted-create-project"></a>

In Amazon Pinpoint, a *project* is a collection of settings, customer information, segments, and campaigns\. If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, the first step you should take is to create a project\.

**Note**  
If you've used the Amazon Pinpoint API, you may have seen references to "applications\." In Amazon Pinpoint, a *project* is the same as an *application*\.

This section shows you how to create a project\. As part of this procedure, you also verify an email address\. You use this address to send email when you create your email campaign later in this tutorial\.

If you've never created a project in your Amazon Pinpoint account, complete the steps in [Option 1: Create and configure a project \(New Amazon Pinpoint Users\)](#gettingstarted-create-project-new-user)\. If your Amazon Pinpoint account already contains one or more projects, complete the steps in [Option 1: Create and Configure a Project \(Existing Amazon Pinpoint Users\)](#gettingstarted-create-project-existing-user) instead\.
