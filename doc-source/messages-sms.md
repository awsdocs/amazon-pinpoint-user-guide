# Sending a Test SMS Message<a name="messages-sms"></a>

To send a test SMS message, you have to use a project in which the SMS channel is enabled\. To learn how to create a new project with SMS support, see [Setting up the Amazon Pinpoint SMS Channel](channels-sms-setup.md)\. To learn how to add SMS support to an existing project, see [Managing the Amazon Pinpoint SMS Channel](channels-sms-manage.md)\.

**To send a test SMS message**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **All projects** page, choose the project that you want to send a test message for\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Test messaging**\.

1. On the **Test messaging** page, under **Channel**, choose **SMS**\.

1. For **Destination type**, choose one of the following destinations for your message:
   + **Phone numbers** – Each destination is a recipient's phone number\.
   + **Endpoint IDs** – Each destination is a unique ID that's assigned to an endpoint for the project\.

1. Depending on your selection for **Destination type**, enter one or more **Endpoint IDs** or **Phone numbers**\. You can enter up to 15 values\. Use commas to separate multiple values\.

   If you use phone numbers as the destination type, specify each number in E\.164 format\. E\.164 is a standard for the phone number structure that's used for international telecommunication\. Phone numbers that follow this format typically have up to 15 digits, and they are prefixed with the plus character \(\+\) and the country code\. For example, a US phone number in E\.164 format appears as \+12065550100\.

1. For **Message type**, choose one of the following:
   + **Promotional** – Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages\. If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost\.
   + **Transactional** – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one\-time passwords for multi\-factor authentication\. If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability\.
**Note**  
This message\-level setting overrides the default message type that you chose on the **Settings** page for the project\.

1. Under **Message**, for **Message content**, choose whether you want to **Create a new message** or **Use an existing template**\. 

   If you choose to use an existing template, choose the template from the **Template** list\. After you choose a template from the list, Amazon Pinpoint displays a preview of the active version of the template\. \(The active version is typically the version of a template that's been reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow\.\) When you finish choosing a template, skip to step 10\.

   If you choose to create a new message, specify the content of the message in the **Message** field\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Sender ID**, enter a custom ID that contains up to 11 alphanumeric characters, including at least one letter, and no spaces\. The sender ID is displayed as the message sender on the recipient's device\. For example, you can use your business brand to make the message source easier to recognize\.

   Support for sender IDs varies by country and/or region\. For more information, see [Supported Countries and Regions \(SMS Channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\.

   This message\-level sender ID overrides your default sender ID, which you chose on the **Settings** page for the project\.

1. When you finish, choose **Send message**\.
