## Editing a 10DLC campaign<a name="settings-sms-10dlc-modify-campaign-edit"></a>

After your campaign is approved, you can modify the HELP, STOP, and sample messages\. You can also add additional sample messages\. Changes to these fields don't require re\-approval from the Campaign Registry or from carriers\. You can't modify any other fields after the 10DLC campaign is approved\.

You can have a maximum of five sample messages\. You can't reduce the number of sample messages that you originally registered\. For example, if you registered your campaign with three sample SMS messages, you can't reduce the number of sample SMS messages to less than three\. 

**Note**  
If you want to modify any fields other than the HELP, STOP, and sample messages, you must first delete the 10DLC campaign and then recreate the campaign to include the updated information\.
