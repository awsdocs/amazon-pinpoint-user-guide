# Add activities to the journey<a name="journeys-add-activities"></a>

Activities are the most important parts of any journey\. Activities represent the steps that are applied to journey participants\. You can use activities to send messages to journey participants across a variety of channels, or to split them into smaller groups, or to wait for a period of time\. There are several different types of activities that you can add to a journey\. This section provides basic information about adding activities to a journey\. For detailed information about setting up each type of activity, see [Setting up journey activities](#journeys-add-activities-procedures)\.

**Note**  
An exit journey element is added to the journey flow after reviewing and publishing your journey\.

## Setting up journey activities<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures"></a>

Each type of journey activity has separate components that you have to configure\. The following sections provide additional information about setting up each type of activity\.

### Set up an email activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-email"></a>

When a journey participant arrives on a **Send email** activity, Amazon Pinpoint sends them an email immediately\. Before you can configure an email activity, you have to create an email template\. For more information about creating email templates, see [Creating email templates](message-templates-creating-email.md)\.

**To set up an email activity**  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/journeys-email-activity.png)

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Send an email**\.

1. Under **Select an email template to use for this activity**, select **Choose an email template**, and then choose the email template for the message that you want participants to receive\. Then, under **Template version behavior**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to automatically update the message to include any changes that you might make to the template before the message is sent\. To learn more about these options, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.
**Tip**  
You can send yourself a preview of the message, even if your Amazon Pinpoint account doesn't contain an endpoint record for your email address\. To send a preview, choose **Send a test message**\.

1. For **Sender email address**, choose the email address that you want to send the message from\. This list contains all the verified email addresses for your Amazon Pinpoint account in the current AWS Region\. For information about verifying additional email addresses or domains, see [Verifying email identities](channels-email-manage-verify.md)\.
**Tip**  
To display a friendly sender name for the message, choose the default email address for the project\. A *friendly sender name* is the name that appears in participants' email clients when they receive the message\. To change the default email address for the project or the friendly sender name for that address, update the project's settings for the email channel\. To do this, choose **Settings** in the left navigation pane, and then choose **Email**\. Then, enter the settings that you want\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter text that describes the purpose of the activity\. When you save the activity, this text appears as its label\.

1. When you finish, choose **Save**\.

### Set up a push notification activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-push"></a>

When a journey participant arrives on a **Send a push notification** activity, Amazon Pinpoint sends them a push notification immediately\. Before you can configure a push notification activity, you have to create a push notification template\. For more information about creating push notification templates, see [Creating push notification templates](message-templates-creating-push.md)\.

**Note**  
To send push notifications to journey participants, your app has to be integrated with an AWS SDK\. For more information, see [Handling Push Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/integrate-push.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

**To set up a push notification activity**

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Send a push notification**\.

1. Under **Choose a push notification template for this activity**, select **Choose a push notification template**, and then choose the push notification template for the message that you want participants to receive\. Then, under **Template version behavior**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to use the template version that is currently designated as active or the template version that was active when the journey was created\. To learn more about these options, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.
**Tip**  
You can send yourself a preview of the message, even if your Amazon Pinpoint account doesn't contain an endpoint ID or device token that you specify\. To send a preview, choose **Send a test message**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Time to live**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to use the default time to live \(TTL\) value or a custom value for each push notification service\. By default, Amazon Pinpoint uses the maximum TTL value of each respective push notification service\. You can also specify a custom TTL value for all push notification services\. If the message delivery fails, the push notification service attempts to deliver the message for the amount of time that you specify in this setting\. For information about specific time to live values, see [Messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-messages.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint API Reference*\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter text that describes the purpose of the activity\. When you save the activity, this text appears as its label\.

1. When you finish, choose **Save**\.

### Set up an SMS message activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-sms"></a>

When a journey participant arrives on a **Send an SMS message** activity, Amazon Pinpoint sends them an SMS message immediately\. Before you can configure an SMS activity, you have to create an SMS template\. For more information about creating SMS templates, see [Creating SMS templates](message-templates-creating-sms.md)\.

**To set up an SMS message activity**  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/journeys-create-step-3-add-activities-procedures-sms.png)

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Send an SMS message**\.

1. Under **Choose an SMS message template for this activity**, select **Choose an SMS message template**, and then choose the SMS message template for the message that you want participants to receive\. Then, under **Template version behavior**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to use the template version that is currently designated as active or the template version that was active when the journey was created\. To learn more about these options, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.

1. Choose **Send a test message** if you want to first test this activity\. Test messages don't count against your daily sending limits, but you are charged for each message\. When sending a test message you're prompted to optionally choose the origination number but required to choose a destination number\.
**Note**  
If your account is in the SMS sandbox, you can only send a test message to one of your verified destination numbers\. If the destination number doesn't appear in the list, choose **Manage numbers** to add that new number\. For more information about verifying destination numbers, see [About the Amazon Pinpoint SMS sandbox](channels-sms-sandbox.md)\.

1. For **Message type**, choose one of the following:
   + **Promotional** – Non\-critical messages, such as marketing messages\.
   + **Transactional** – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one\-time passwords for multi\-factor authentication\.

1. \(Optional\) If necessary, expand the **Additional settings** section to configure optional SMS\-related settings\. The **Additional settings** section contains two tabs:
   + On the **SMS Settings** tab you can configure the following settings:
     + **Origination phone number** – The phone number that messages will be sent from\. This list contains all of the dedicated phone numbers that are present in your Amazon Pinpoint account\.
     + **Sender ID** – An alphanumeric ID that identifies the sender of the SMS message\. The Sender ID appears on your recipients' devices only if the recipient is in a country where Sender IDs are supported\. If you specify a Sender ID in a journey activity, it overrides the default value for your account\. To learn more about which countries support Sender IDs, see [Supported countries and regions \(SMS channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\. 
**Note**  
You only need to set one of these values\. If you specify both values, Amazon Pinpoint attempts to send the message using the dedicated origination phone number\.
   + On the **Regulatory Settings** tab, you can configure settings that apply specifically to sending messages to recipients in India\. If you send messages to recipients in India, you must specify a Sender ID, as well as both of the following values:
     + **Entity ID** – The ID that is associated with your company or brand, provided by TRAI during the Sender ID registration process\.
     + **Template ID** – The ID that is associated with your message template\. This value is also provided by TRAI during the Sender ID registration process\.
**Note**  
If you don't send messages to recipients in India, or if you send messages to India using International Long\-Distance Operator routes, you don't need to specify the **Entity ID** and **Template ID** values\.  
For more information about the regulatory requirements for sending SMS messages to India, see [Special requirements for sending SMS messages to recipients in India](channels-sms-senderid-india.md)\.

### Set up a contact center activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-contact-center"></a>

When a journey participant arrives on a **Send through a contact center** activity, Amazon Pinpoint places them into an Amazon Connect outbound campaigns \(referred to in Amazon Pinpoint as an *Amazon Connect campaign*\)\. You can configure this activity type to dial the journey participant's phone number and either connect them to an agent, or play a voice message\.

Contact center activities behave slightly differently when compared to other types of journey activities\. When a journey participant arrives on a **Send through a contact center** activity, all of the preceding activities that involve a decision \(specifically, journey entry, **Multivariate split** and **Yes/no split** activities\) are re\-evaluated immediately before the participant's phone number is dialed\.

For example, assume a journey contains an entry step that adds members of a specific segment into the journey, and a **Yes/no split** activity that checks to see if the journey participant has completed a specific type of transaction\. In this scenario, the "yes" branch of the yes/no split \(for participants who complete the transaction\) sends a follow\-up email, while the "no" branch \(for participants who didn't complete the transaction\) leads to a contact center activity\. Participants who arrive on the contact center activity remain there until an agent is available to call them\. When an agent becomes available, the journey re\-evaluates the participant's attributes against the criteria in the journey entry step and the yes/no split activity\.

The purpose of this re\-evaluation process is to ensure that the journey participant still qualifies to receive a phone call at the moment the phone call is placed\. This behavior is useful because the participant's attributes could change between the time when they arrive on the contact center activity and the time when an agent becomes available to call them\. This feature is enabled by default and can't be turned off\.

#### Prerequisites<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-contact-center-prereqs"></a>

Before you can add a contact center activity to a journey, you must do the following:
+ Create an Amazon Connect account and instance\.
+ Use Amazon AppIntegrations to enable high\-volume outbound campaigns for your Amazon Connect instance\.
+ Enable your Amazon Connect instance for outbound calling\.
+ Create a dedicated outbound communications queue to handle any contacts that will be routed to agents as a result of the campaign\. The queue must be assigned to the agent's routing profile\.
+ Create and publish a contact flow that includes a **Check call progress** block\. This block enables you to branch based on whether a person answered the phone, for example, or a voice mail was detected\.
+ Make sure that the Amazon Connect queue you plan to use has an outbound number defined in the queue\.
+ In IAM, create a policy and role that allow Amazon Connect to send messages through Amazon Pinpoint\.
**Note**  
 The **ResourceID** roles specified for **ConnectCampaignExecutionRoleArn** are not allowed to contain service\-roles or sub\-paths\. This means that the IAM role name, passed via the request parameter: `arn:aws:iam::account:role/role-name-without-path`, should not contain a sub\-path delimited by a "/" after the role name\. For example:   
Valid role ARN in request parameters:`"ConnectCampaignExecutionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456781234:role/testuser"`
Invalid role ARN in request parameters: `"ConnectCampaignExecutionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456781234:role/testuser/subrole"`

You can find procedures for completing these tasks in steps 1–5 of [Make predictive and progressive calls using Amazon Connect outbound](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/make-predictive-and-progressive-calls-using-amazon-connect-high-volume-outbound-communications/) on the AWS Contact Center blog\. 

#### Setting up a contact center activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-contact-center-setting-up"></a>

 You can connect your journey to an existing Amazon Connect outbound campaign,, or click to build an Amazon Connect outbound campaign\.

Note the following considerations when using contact center activities in Amazon Pinpoint:
+ You can only use 3 contact center activities in a Journey\. If you need more than 3 contact center activities you can request a quota increase\. See [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/quotas.html#quotas-increase) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.
+ You can only use one Amazon Connect campaign per journey\. If a journey contains multiple contact center activities, and you change the Amazon Connect campaign for one activity, the change is reflected in all other contact center activities in the same journey\.
+ You can use a single Amazon Connect campaign in multiple journeys\. Amazon Pinpoint shows a warning if the Amazon Connect campaign is already in use when you publish the journey\.
+ Your phone numbers of your customers must exist in Amazon Pinpoint as voice endpoints\.
+ Endpoint phone numbers must be in E\.164 format\. For more information, see [E\.164: The international public telecommunication numbering plan](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en) on the International Telecommunications Union web site\.

### Set up a custom message channel activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-custom"></a>

When a journey participant arrives on a **Send through a custom channel** activity, Amazon Pinpoint sends information about the participant to an AWS Lambda function or webhook\. A custom channel allows you to send messages to your customers through any service that has an API, including non\-AWS services\.

Before you can configure a custom channel activity, you need to decide whether to use a Lambda function or a webhook URL to send your message\. For more information about creating custom message channels, see [Creating custom channels in Amazon Pinpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/channels-custom.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

### Set up a wait activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-wait"></a>

When a journey participant arrives on a **Wait** activity, they remain on that activity for a certain period of time or until a specific date and time\. This type of activity is a useful way to schedule the sending of time\-sensitive communications, or to give customers time to interact with messages that you sent earlier in the journey\.

**To set up a wait activity**  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/journeys-wait-activity.png)

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Wait**\.

   + **For a period of time** – Choose this option if you want journey participants to remain on this activity for a certain amount of time\. Then, enter the amount of time that you want journey participants to wait on this activity before they proceed to the next activity\. You can specify a value that's as short as 1 hour or as long as 365 days\.
   + **Until a specific date** – Choose this option if you want journey participants to remain on this activity until a specific date and time\. Then, enter the date and time when journey participants should move to the next activity\. You can choose any date and time that precedes the end date of the journey\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter text that describes the purpose of the activity\. When you save the activity, this text appears as its label\.

1. When you finish, choose **Save**\.

### Set up a yes/no split activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-yes-no-split"></a>

When journey participants arrive on a **yes/no split** activity, they're sent down one of two paths based on their attributes or behaviors\. You can use this type of split activity to send journey participants down separate paths based on their membership in a segment\. You can also send participants down separate paths based on their interactions with other journey activities\. For example, you can divide journey participants based on whether they opened an email that was sent earlier in the journey\.

**Note**  
To create split activities that send participants down different paths based on push notification events \(such as Open or Received events\), your mobile app has to specify the User ID and Endpoint ID values\. For more information, see [Integrating Amazon Pinpoint with your application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/integrate.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.  
If the Journey segment is at the user\-level, with user\_id in the data and the criteria used for evaluating a conditional split is an endpoint attribute, Amazon Pinpoint processes the journey attributes using a logical OR between the attribute values for the different endpoints of the user\. For example, if a single user has multiple endpoints, and if any of these endpoints had the criteria satisfied, all endpoints linked to that user would be grouped together and evaluated as a ‘Yes’, and would go down the ‘Yes’ branch of a Yes/No split activity\.

**To set up a yes/no split activity**  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/journeys-yes-no-split-activity.png)

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Yes/no split**\.

1. For **Select a condition type**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Segment** – Choose this option to send all members of the chosen segment down the "Yes" path\. Then, for **Segments**, choose a segment\.
   + **Event** – Choose this option to send users down the "Yes" path based on their interactions with a previous step in this journey\. Then, complete the following steps:

     1. For **Events**, select the messaging activity you want to split on:

     1. For **Choose an activity**, choose the message activity that the split should be applied to\. Depending on the channel type of messaging activity you select you will have the following options on split on:
        + For **Email** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Send** – Amazon Pinpoint accepted the message and will attempt to deliver it\.
          + **Delivered** – The message was successfully delivered to the recipient\.
          + **Rejected** – Amazon Pinpoint rejected the message because it contained a virus or malware\.
          + **Hard bounce** – The email wasn't delivered to the recipient because of a permanent issue\. For example, the recipient's email address might not exist anymore\. When a message generates a hard bounce, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't attempt to re\-deliver it\.
          + **Soft bounce** – The email wasn't delivered to the recipient because of a temporary issue\. For example, the recipient's inbox could be full, or their email provider might be experiencing a temporary issue\. When a soft bounce occurs, Amazon Pinpoint attempts to re\-deliver the message for a certain period of time\. If the message still can't be delivered, the message becomes a hard bounce\.
          + **Complaint** – The recipient received the email, but used the "Report spam" or similar button in their email client to report the message as unwanted\.
**Note**  
Amazon Pinpoint relies on complaint reports from email providers to generate complaint events\. Some email providers give us these reports on a regular basis, while others send them infrequently\.
          + **Open** – The recipient received the email and opened it\.
**Note**  
For Amazon Pinpoint to capture an **Email open** event, the recipient's email client has to download the images contained in the message\. Many common email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, don't download email images by default\.
          + **Click** – The recipient received the email and followed one of the links contained in the body of the message\.
          + **Unsubscribe** – The recipient received the email and used the "Unsubscribe" link to opt out of future messages\.
        + For **SMS** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Send** – Amazon Pinpoint attempted to send the message\. 
          + **Delivered** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was delivered\. 
          + **Failed** – An error occurred when delivering the message to the endpoint address\. 
          + **Opt\-out** – The user who's associated with the endpoint address has opted out of receiving messages from you\. 
        + For **Push** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Send** – Amazon Pinpoint attempted to send the message\. 
          + **Opened notification** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was opened by the user\. 
          + **Received foreground** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was received by the users device and displayed in the foreground\. 
          + **Received background** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was received by the users device and displayed in the background\. 
        + For **Contact Center** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Connected** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the call was connected to an agent\. 
          + **SIT tone** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a busy tone\. 
          + **Fax** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a fax tone\. 
          + **Voicemail beep** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a voicemail with beep\. 
          + **Voicemail no beep** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a voicemail without beep\. 
          + **Not answered** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call was not answered and rang out without a voicemail\. 
        + **Custom channel** – For the custom channel activity you can define the response attribute and value you would like to split on\. You must ensure this attribute and value is passed back to Amazon Pinpoint journeys in a way that can be read\. For more information about how this response should be structured, see [Creating custom channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/channels-custom.html) in Amazon Pinpoint in the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide\. 

     1. 
**Note**  
\(Optional\) For custom channel activities you can split based on the **Call to a function or webhook response**\. To configure this can you define:  
**Attribute** – The name of the attribute to evaluate\.
**Value** – The value used to determine in which way to split\.

1. For **Condition evaluation**, choose when Amazon Pinpoint should evaluate the condition\. You can choose from the following options:
   + **Evaluate immediately** – If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint checks to see if the event condition that you specified has been met the moment when the journey participant arrives on the activity\.
   + **Evaluate after** – If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint waits for a specified period of time\. After the specified period of time has elapsed, Amazon Pinpoint checks to see if the event condition that you specified has been met\.
   + **Evaluate on** – If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint waits until a specific date and time\. When that date and time arrives, Amazon Pinpoint checks to see if the event condition that you specified has been met\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter text that describes the purpose of the activity\. When you save the activity, this text appears as its label\.

1. When you finish, choose **Save**\.

### Set up a multivariate split activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-multivariate-split"></a>

When journey participants arrive on a **Multivariate split** activity, they're sent down one of several paths based on their attributes or behaviors\. This type of split is similar to a yes/no split\. The advantage of using a multivariate split activity is that it can evaluate more than one condition\. Additionally, every multivariate split activity contains an "Else" path\. Journey participants who don't meet any of the conditions that you specified in other paths are automatically sent down the "Else" path\.

You can use this type of split to send journey participants down separate paths based on their membership in a segment\. You can also send participants down separate paths based on their interactions with other journey activities\. For example, you can divide journey participants based on whether they opened an email that was sent earlier in the journey\.

**Note**  
If a journey participant meets more than one condition in a conditional split, they are sent down the first condition that they meet, in alphabetical order\. For example, if a participant meets the conditions in Branch A and Branch D, they're sent down the path that corresponds with Branch A\.  
To create split activities that send participants down different paths based on push notification events \(such as Open or Received events\), your mobile app has to specify the User ID and Endpoint ID values\.

If the Journey segment is at the user\-level, with user\_id in the data and the criteria used for evaluating a conditional split is an endpoint attribute, Amazon Pinpoint processes the journey attributes using a logical OR between the attribute values for the different endpoints of the user\. For example, if a single user has multiple endpoints, and if any of these endpoints had the criteria satisfied, all endpoints linked to that user would be grouped together and evaluated as a ‘Yes’, and would go down the ‘Yes’ branch of a Yes/No split activity\.

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Multivariate split**\.

1. Determine how many different paths \(branches\) you want to create\. Choose **Add another branch** to create additional paths\.

1. On each branch, for **Select a condition type**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Segment** – Choose this option to send all members of the chosen segment down the path\. Then, for **Segments**, choose a segment\.
   + **Event** – Choose this option to send users down the path based on their interactions with a previous step in this journey\. Then, complete the following steps:

     1. For **Events**, select the messaging activity you would like to split on\.

     1. For **Choose an activity**, choose the message activity that the split should be applied to\. Depending on the channel type of messaging activity you select you will have the following options on split on:
        + For **Email** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Send** – Amazon Pinpoint accepted the message and will attempt to deliver it\.
          + **Delivered** – The message was successfully delivered to the recipient\.
          + **Rejected** – Amazon Pinpoint rejected the message because it contained a virus or malware\.
          + **Hard bounce** – The email wasn't delivered to the recipient because of a permanent issue\. For example, the recipient's email address might not exist anymore\. When a message generates a hard bounce, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't attempt to re\-deliver it\.
          + **Soft bounce** – The email wasn't delivered to the recipient because of a temporary issue\. For example, the recipient's inbox could be full, or their email provider might be experiencing a temporary issue\. When a soft bounce occurs, Amazon Pinpoint attempts to re\-deliver the message for a certain period of time\. If the message still can't be delivered, the message becomes a hard bounce\.
          + **Complaint** – The recipient received the email, but used the "Report spam" or similar button in their email client to report the message as unwanted\.
**Note**  
Amazon Pinpoint relies on complaint reports from email providers to generate complaint events\. Some email providers give us these reports on a regular basis, while others send them infrequently\.
          + **Open** – The recipient received the email and opened it\.
**Note**  
For Amazon Pinpoint to capture an **Email open** event, the recipient's email client has to download the images contained in the message\. Many common email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, don't download email images by default\.
          + **Click** – The recipient received the email and followed one of the links contained in the body of the message\.
          + **Unsubscribe** – The recipient received the email and used the "Unsubscribe" link to opt out of future messages\.
        + For **SMS** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Send** – Amazon Pinpoint attempted to send the message\. 
          + **Delivered** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was delivered\. 
          + **Failed** – An error occurred when delivering the message to the endpoint address\. 
          + **Opt\-out** – The user who's associated with the endpoint address has opted out of receiving messages from you\. 
        + For **Push** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Send** – Amazon Pinpoint attempted to send the message\. 
          + **Opened notification** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was opened by the user\. 
          + **Received foreground** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was received by the users device and displayed in the foreground\. 
          + **Received background** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the message was received by the users device and displayed in the background\. 
        + For **Contact Center** here are the events you can select\.
          + **Connected** – Amazon Pinpoint received a confirmation the call was connected to an agent\. 
          + **SIT tone** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a busy tone\. 
          + **Fax** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a fax tone\. 
          + **Voicemail beep** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a voicemail with beep\. 
          + **Voicemail no beep** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call gave back a voicemail without beep\. 
          + **Not answered** – Amazon Pinpoint received a response the call was not answered and rang out without a voicemail\. 
        + **Custom channel** – For the custom channel activity you can define the response attribute and value you would like to split on\. You must ensure this attribute and value is passed back to Amazon Pinpoint journeys in a way that can be read\. For more information about how this response should be structured, see [Creating custom channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/channels-custom.html) in Amazon Pinpoint in the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide\. 

     1. For **Choose a journey message activity and event** choose Call to a function or webhook response\.
        + **Attribute** – The name of the attribute to evaluate\.
        + **Value** – The value used to determine which branch to traverse for the path\.

   Repeat this step for each path in the activity\.

1. For **Condition evaluation**, choose when Amazon Pinpoint should evaluate the condition\. You can choose from the following options:
   + **Evaluate immediately** – If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint checks to see if the event condition that you specified has been met at the moment the journey participant arrives on the activity\.
   + **Evaluate after** – If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint waits for a specified period of time\. After the specified period of time has elapsed, Amazon Pinpoint checks to see if the event condition that you specified has been met\.
   + **Evaluate on** – If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint waits until a specific date and time\. When that date and time arrives, Amazon Pinpoint checks to see if the event condition that you specified has been met\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter text that describes the purpose of the activity\. When you save the activity, this text appears as its label\.

1. When you finish, choose **Save**\.

### Set up a holdout activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-holdout"></a>

When journey participants arrive on a **Holdout** activity, the journey ends for a random selection of participants\. You can specify the percentage of total journey participants who are held out\. Holdout activities can help you measure the impact of a journey by creating a control group that doesn't receive your messages\. When a journey finishes running, you can compare the behaviors of the users who participated in the journey against those who were part of the control group\.

**Note**  
Amazon Pinpoint uses a probability\-based algorithm to determine which journey participants are held out\. The percentage of journey participants who are held out will be very close to the percentage that you specify, but it might not be perfectly equal\.

**To set up a holdout activity**

1. Choose **Add activity**\.

1. For **Add an activity**, choose **Holdout**\.

1. For **Holdout percentage**, enter the percentage of journey participants who should be prevented from proceeding to the next activity in the journey\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter text that describes the purpose of the activity\. When you save the activity, this text appears as its label\.

1. When you finish, choose **Save**\.

### Set up a random split activity<a name="journeys-add-activities-procedures-random-split"></a>

When journey participants arrive on a **Random split** activity, they're randomly sent down one of up to five paths\. You can create two to five separate paths for this type of activity\. This type of activity is useful when you want to measure the effectiveness of different message variants\.

**Note**  
Amazon Pinpoint uses a probability\-based algorithm to determine which journey participants are sent down each path in a random split activity\. The percentages of journey participants who are sent down each path will be very close to the percentages that you specify, but they might not be perfectly equal\.

**To set up a random split activity**
