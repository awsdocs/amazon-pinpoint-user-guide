You can use the voice channel to create voice messages from a text script, and then send those messages to your customers over the phone\. The voice channel is a great way to reach customers whose phone numbers aren't able to receive SMS messages—for example, customers who use landlines or VoIP services\.

To send voice messages using Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to enable the voice channel in your project and lease a dedicated phone number for sending the messages\. Depending on how you use Amazon Pinpoint to send voice messages, you might also want to change certain settings for your account\.
