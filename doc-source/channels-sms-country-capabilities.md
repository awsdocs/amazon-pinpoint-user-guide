# Country capabilities and limitations for SMS with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-sms-country-capabilities"></a>

Amazon Pinpoint includes support for *two\-way SMS*, which allows you to receive messages from your customers\. You can configure Amazon Pinpoint to automatically send responses to your customers based on the content of the messages they send you\. Amazon Pinpoint is currently unable to send SMS messages to a small number of countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan\. For a complete list of countries and regions that you can send SMS messages to, see [Supported countries and regions \(SMS channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\.

Most countries and regions place restrictions on the type of content that you can send using SMS\. These restrictions vary, but the following types of content are restricted in most countries or regions:
+ Pornographic content
+ Content that is profane or hateful
+ Content that depicts or endorses violence
+ Content that endorses illegal drugs

In many countries and regions, if a customer receives restricted content and complains to a mobile carrier or regulatory agency, the sender might be subject to fines and penalties\. Governments of a few countries and regions actively filter all incoming messages to remove content that they deem offensive or inappropriate\. Always familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations about sending commercial SMS messages for the countries and regions where your customers are located\.

Each country might also have additional capabilities and limitations when using SMS with Amazon Pinpoint\. These capabilities and limitations are described in the following topics\.

**Note**  
Two\-way SMS is only available in certain countries and regions\. For more information about two\-way SMS support by country or region, see [Supported countries and regions \(SMS channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\.
