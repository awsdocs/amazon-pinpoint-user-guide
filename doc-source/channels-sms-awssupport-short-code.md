# Requesting Dedicated Short Codes for SMS Messaging with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-sms-awssupport-short-code"></a>

A short code is a number that you can use for high\-volume SMS message sending\. Short codes are often used for application\-to\-person \(A2P\) messaging, two\-factor authentication \(2FA\), and marketing\. A short code typically contains between three and seven digits, depending on the country or region that it's based in\.

You can only use short codes to send messages to recipients in the same country where the short code is based\. If your use case requires you to use short codes in more than one country, you have to request a separate short code for each country that your recipients are located in\.

For information about short code pricing, see [Amazon Pinpoint Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/pricing/#Dedicated_Short_Codes)\.

**Important**  
If you're new to SMS messaging with Amazon Pinpoint, request a monthly SMS spending threshold that meets the expected demands of your SMS use case\. By default, your monthly spending threshold is $1\.00 \(USD\)\. You can request to increase your spending threshold in the same support case that includes your request for a short code\. Or, you can use a separate case\. For more information, see [Requesting Increases to Your Monthly SMS Spending Quota for Amazon Pinpoint](channels-sms-awssupport-spend-threshold.md)\.  
In addition, if you're requesting a dedicated short code to send messages that will or may contain Protected Health Information \(PHI\), you should identify this purpose in your **Case description** when you open a support case, as detailed below\.

   + The response that you want to send when customers reply to your messages with the keyword *STOP*\. This message has to confirm that the user will no longer receive messages from you\. For example: *You are unsubscribed from *ProductName* Alerts\. No more messages will be sent\. Reply HELP for help or *\(800\) 555\-0199*\.*
   + The text that you plan to send as a periodic reminder that the user is subscribed to your messages\. For example: *Reminder: You're subscribed to account alerts from ExampleCorp\. Msg&data rates may apply\. Txt STOP to cancel or HELP for info\.*
   + An example of each type of message that you plan to send using your short code\. Provide at least three examples\. If you plan to send more than three types of messages, provide examples for all of them\.
**Important**  
Mobile carriers require us to provide all of the information listed above in order to provision short codes\. We can't process your request until you provide all of this information\.

1. Under **Contact options**, for **Preferred contact language**, choose whether you want to receive communications for this case in **English** or **Japanese**\.

1. When you finish, choose **Submit**\.

After we receive your request, we provide an initial response within 24 hours\. We might contact you to request additional information\. If we're able to provide you with a short code, we send you information about the costs associated with obtaining a short code in the country or region that you specified in your request\. We also provide an estimate of the amount of time that's required to provision a short code in your country or region\. It usually takes several weeks to provision a short code, although this delay can be much shorter or much longer depending on the country or region where the short code is based\.

**Note**  
The fees associated with using short codes begin immediately after we initiate your short code request with carriers\. You're responsible for paying these charges, even if the short code hasn't been completely provisioned yet\.

In order to prevent our systems from being used to send unsolicited or malicious content, we have to consider each request carefully\. We might not be able to grant your request if your use case doesn’t align with our policies\.

## Step 2: Update Your SMS Settings in the Amazon Pinpoint Console<a name="channels-sms-awssupport-short-code-settings"></a>

1. On the **All projects** page, choose a project that the SMS channel is enabled in\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, choose **SMS and voice**\. 

1. Under **Number settings**, choose the short code\.

1. Under **Default keywords**, verify that the responses for the *HELP* and *STOP* keywords match the values that you specified in your request\.

1. Under **Registered keyword**, verify that the opt\-in keyword and response match the values that you specified in your request\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want to specify additional keyword responses, or if you want to process inbound messages outside of Amazon Pinpoint, you can enable two\-way SMS\. For more information, see [Two\-Way SMS Settings](settings-sms.md#settings-account-sms-number-2way)\.
