# Amazon Pinpoint in\-app messaging channel<a name="channels-inapp"></a>

You can use in\-app messages to send targeted messages to users of your applications\. In\-app messages are highly customizable\. They can include buttons that open websites or take users to specific parts of your app\. You can configure background and text colors, position the text, and add buttons and images to the notification\. You can send a single message, or create a carousel that contains up to five unique messages\. Unlike other channels such as email or SMS, in\-app messages are enabled by default in all Amazon Pinpoint projects\. Additionally, in\-app messages do not support the use of substitution variables\.

You can use AWS Amplify to seamlessly integrate the in\-app messaging capabilities of Amazon Pinpoint into your app\. Amplify can automatically handle the processes of fetching messages, rendering messages, and sending analytics data to Amazon Pinpoint\. This integration is currently supported for React Native applications\. For more information, see [In\-App Messaging](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/in-app-messaging/overview/q/platform/js/) in the *Amplify Framework Documentation*\.

## How Amazon Pinpoint handles in\-app messages<a name="channels-inapp-about"></a>

Displaying in\-app messages to your users consists of three steps\. The first step is to create the message template\. The message template defines the appearance and content of the message\. In\-app messages can be single messages that appear on the screen, messages that cover the entire screen, or carousels that consist of up to five messages\. For more information about creating in\-app message templates, see [Creating in\-app templates](message-templates-creating-inapp.md)\.

Next, you create an in\-app campaign\. You can configure your campaign to be sent when certain events occur\. For example, you can trigger the campaign to send when a user reaches a certain level in a game, or when they look at a certain item in your online store\. For more information about creating campaigns, see [Amazon Pinpoint campaigns](campaigns.md)\.

**Note**  
In order to receive in\-app messages, the endpoints that your campaign targets must have an endpoint type of `IN_APP`\.

Finally, to display the in\-app messages in your app, your app must call the [GetInAppMessages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-endpoints-endpoint-id-inappmessages.html) API to retrieve the messages\. The response provides a JSON\-formatted list of the messages that each user is entitled to\. When messages are displayed to users, you can pass analytics events back to Amazon Pinpoint\. Doing this allows you to collect metrics for the in\-app message campaign\. For more information about using in\-app notifications in your apps, see [Working with in\-app messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/channels-inapp.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide* or [Dynamically personalize your in\-product user experience using Amazon Pinpoint in\-app messaging](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/dynamically-personalize-your-in-product-user-experience-using-amazon-pinpoint-in-app-messaging/) on the AWS Messaging and Targeting Blog\.
