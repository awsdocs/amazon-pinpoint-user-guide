## Summary<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain-overview"></a>

This section contains information about the percentage of emails from a specific domain that arrived in your customers' inboxes\. It also provides information about the percentage of emails that your customers engaged with by opening them or by clicking links in them\. Finally, it shows the number of deny lists that the IP addresses associated with the domain are on\.

**Note**  
The information in this section contains general guidance, as opposed to exact metrics\. If you need precise metrics related to the delivery of your mail and engagement with it, you should set up [event streams](settings-event-streams.md)\.

To view data in this section, choose a subscribed domain, as shown in the following image\. When you choose a domain, data appears in the **Summary**, **Inbox placement by email provider**, and **Deny list activities** sections\.

When you choose a domain and a date range, the **Deliverability overview** section shows the following information:
+ **Engagement rate** – The percentage of email sent from the selected domain that recipients opened or clicked links in\. When determining whether to deliver your email to recipient's inboxes, many email providers \(especially larger ones\) consider how often recipients engaged with email sent from your domain in the past month or two\. For this reason, you should try to maintain an engagement rate of at least 25%\.
+ **Inbox placement rate** – The percentage of email sent from the selected domain that arrived in recipients' inboxes\. An inbox placement rate of around 80% is considered average\.
+ **Deny list activities** – The number of deny lists that IP addresses associated with the domain appear on\. To learn more about deny lists, see [Deny list activities](#channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain-denylist)\.

### Alarms<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain-overview-alarms"></a>

On the **Alarms** tab, you can create alarms that send you notifications for any of the metrics in the **Summary** section\.

**To create an alarm**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Deliverability dashboard**\.

1. On the **Alarms** tab, choose **Create alarm**\.

1. On the **Create alarm** page, do the following:

   1. For **Alarm name**, enter a name that helps you easily identify the alarm\.

   1. For **Send notification when the**, choose one of the following options:
      + **Inbox placement rate** – When you choose this option, the alarm considers the inbox placement rate across all email providers\.
      + **Inbox placement rate** – When you choose this option, the alarm considers the inbox placement rate for specific email providers, such as Gmail or Yahoo\. When you choose this option, you also have to choose the email provider that the alarm applies to\.

   1. Configure the values that cause the alarm to be triggered\. For example, if you want to be notified when the inbox placement rate for your account is 75% or less, choose **<=**\. Then enter a value of **75**, as shown in the following image\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/deliverability_dashboard_domain_alarms_threshold.png)

   1. Specify the amount of time that has to elapse before the alarm is triggered\. For example, you can configure the alarm so that it only sends a notification when the inbox placement rate goes below a certain rate and stays below that rate for more than 2 days\. In this example, next to **for at least**, enter a value of **2**\. Then, next to **consecutive period\(s\) of**, choose **1 day**, as shown in the following image\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/images/deliverability_dashboard_domain_alarms_period.png)

   1. Under **Notification method**, choose one of the following options:
      + **Use an existing SNS topic** – Choose this option if you've already created an Amazon SNS topic and subscribed endpoints to it\.
      + **Create a new topic** – Choose this option if you haven't yet created an Amazon SNS topic, or if you want to create a new topic\.
**Note**  
When you create a new topic, you have to subscribe one or more endpoints to it\. For more information, see [Subscribing an endpoint to a topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tutorial-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

   1. \(Optional\) You can choose or create more than one Amazon SNS topic\. To add a topic, choose **Notify an additional SNS topic**\.

   1. When you finish, choose **Create**\.

## Inbox placement by email provider<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain-inbox-placement"></a>

This section shows you how different email providers handled the email that was sent from your domain during the selected time period\. The email providers analyzed in this section include Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, and AOL\. This section also contains a category called **Others**\. This category includes internet service providers and regional providers\. When combined, the delivery metrics in this section represent a vast majority of all consumer email sent worldwide\.

This section includes average rates for inbox placement and spam folder placement for each email provider\. It also includes a chart, shown in the following image, that displays the inbox placement rate for each provider for every day in the analysis period\. You can use the information in this chart to help identify campaigns that resulted in poor delivery rates\.

**Note**  
You can use the date filter to choose a date range that contains up to 30 days\.

## Deny list activities<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain-denylist"></a>

This section helps you to quickly identify deny list events that could impact the delivery of emails sent from your domain\. A *deny list* is a list of IP addresses that are suspected of sending unsolicited or malicious email\. Different deny list providers have different criteria for adding IP addresses to their lists, and for removing \("delisting"\) IP addresses from their lists\. Additionally, each email provider uses a different deny list or set of deny lists\. Also, each provider weighs deny listing events differently\. If one of your dedicated IP addresses is listed in this section, it doesn't necessarily mean that there will be any impact on the delivery of your email\.

If one of your dedicated IP addresses appears in this section, you should contact the organization that manages the deny list, and request that your IP address be removed\. The following table includes a list of deny list operators that are considered in this section, and includes links to their procedures for delisting an IP address\.

## Domain authentication<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-domain-authentication"></a>

This section contains information about the various methods that you can use to authenticate your domains\. To configure DKIM or SPF authentication for a domain, you need to add specific records to the DNS configuration for the domain\. To view these records, choose **View the DNS record**\.

The procedures for updating the DNS records for a domain vary depending on which DNS or web hosting provider you use\. See your provider's documentation for more information about adding DNS records\.
