# Amazon Pinpoint Email Channel<a name="channels-email"></a>

To engage your user segment with an email campaign, enable the email channel in Amazon Pinpoint\.

When you initially enable the email channel, your AWS account has access only to the email sandbox\. With sandbox access, you can send 200 emails per 24\-hour period at a maximum rate of one email per second\. In addition, you can send email only to addresses that you verify\. To increase your sending limits and to send email to unverified email addresses, [request production access for email](channels-email-setup-production-access.md)\.

You can [monitor your email activity](channels-email-monitor.md) by viewing analytics in the Amazon Pinpoint console or by streaming email events to Kinesis\.

As your email needs change, you can manage your email channel by [updating your email address or domain](channels-email-manage-update.md) or [requesting a sending limits increase](channels-email-manage-limits.md)\.
