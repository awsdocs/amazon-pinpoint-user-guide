# Message routes<a name="channels-sms-limitations-routes"></a>

The route your message uses is dependent on the type set for the message, either **promotional** or **transactional**\. When purchasing a new number using the Amazon Pinpoint console you'll be prompted to choose the route type\. A promotional route are typically marketing or sales\-related messages\. Some countries or regions have quiet time hours when you're not permitted to send promotional messages\. A transactional route is for more time\-sensitive, such as password resets or one\-time passwords\. This can be applied to the number when you're purchasing a new number or can be passed as an optional parameter in the SendMessages operation of the Amazon Pinpoint API\. When sending a message using that number as the originator, Amazon Pinpoint then chooses the applicable promotional or transactional route\.

You pass the route type as an optional parameter using the [SendMessages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-messages.html#SendMessages) operation of the Amazon Pinpoint API\. In some cases you might use a SenderID as the originator, or you might have a shared pool of numbers\. If you have both transactional and promotional numbers associated with your account for the destination country, Amazon Pinpoint chooses a transactional number by default\. Delivery receipts and the Delivery dashboard show the route as either promotional or transactional, based on the chosen number\.
