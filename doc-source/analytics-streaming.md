# Streaming events with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="analytics-streaming"></a>

Amazon Pinpoint can stream engagement and application usage data, known as *event data*, to supported AWS services that provide more options for analysis and storage\. *Event data* can be used to troubleshoot issues by viewing individual events or to view individual customer events, see [Streaming Amazon Pinpoint events to Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/event-streams.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

After you integrate your application with Amazon Pinpoint, it reports events, such as the number of sessions started by users\. Amazon Pinpoint provides this data in the analytics charts and metrics for that application in the console\. The analytics data also shows campaign events generated by Amazon Pinpoint, such as the number of devices that a campaign sent messages to\.

Amazon Pinpoint retains this data for 90 days\. To keep this data for an indefinite period of time or to analyze it with custom queries and tools, you can configure Amazon Pinpoint to send event data to Amazon Kinesis\.

## About Amazon Kinesis<a name="analytics-streaming-about-kinesis"></a>

The Kinesis platform offers services that you can use to load and analyze streaming data on AWS\. You can configure Amazon Pinpoint to send application, campaign, and journey events to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\. By streaming your events, you enable more flexible options for data analysis, such as:
+ Converging the events from multiple applications into one stream so that you can analyze this data as a collection\.
+ Analyzing events with AWS query services\. For example, you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to run SQL queries against streaming data\.

### About Amazon Kinesis Data Streams<a name="analytics-streaming-about-kinesis-streams"></a>

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a service that you can use to build custom applications that process or analyze your streaming data\. For example, streaming your events to Kinesis Data Streams is useful if you want to use event data in custom dashboards, generate alerts based on events, or dynamically respond to events\.

For more information, see the [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/)\.

### About Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose<a name="analytics-streaming-about-kinesis-firehose"></a>

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a service that you can use to deliver your streaming data to AWS data stores, including Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon Redshift, or Amazon OpenSearch Service \(OpenSearch Service\)\. For example, streaming your events to Kinesis Data Firehose is useful if you want to:
+ Use your own analytics applications and tools to analyze events in Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or OpenSearch Service\.
+ Send your events to Amazon S3 so that you can write SQL queries on this data with Amazon Athena\.
+ Back up your event data for long\-term storage in Amazon S3\.

For more information, see the [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/)\.

## Streaming Amazon Pinpoint events to Kinesis<a name="analytics-streaming-kinesis"></a>

The Kinesis platform offers services that you can use to load and analyze streaming data on AWS\. You can configure Amazon Pinpoint to send application, campaign, and journey events to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for processing by external applications or third\-party analytics tools\. You can also configure Amazon Pinpoint to stream this event data to AWS data stores \(such as Amazon Redshift\) using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\.

### Prerequisites<a name="analytics-streaming-kinesis-prerequisites"></a>

Before you complete the procedure in this section, create an Amazon Kinesis stream or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream in the same account in which you use Amazon Pinpoint\. To learn more about creating Kinesis streams, see [Creating and updating data streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/amazon-kinesis-streams.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*\. To learn more about creating Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, see [Creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide*\.

You can optionally create an IAM role that grants permission to send data to your stream\. If you don't create this role, Amazon Pinpoint can create one for you\. For more information about creating this policy manually, see [IAM role for streaming events to Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-streams.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

### Setting up event streaming<a name="analytics-streaming-kinesis-setup"></a>

Complete the following steps in Amazon Pinpoint to set up event streaming\.

**Note**  
If you haven't already created an Amazon Kinesis stream, go to the Amazon Kinesis console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kinesis](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis)\. For more information about creating streams, see the [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/) or the [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/)\.  
Verify you have the permissions to setup and send to the stream\. For more information about permissions see [IAM role for streaming events to Kinesis](/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-streams.html)

**To set up event streaming**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **All projects** page, choose the project that you want to set up data streaming for\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, choose **Event stream**\.

1. In the **Services** section, choose **Edit**\.

1. Choose **Stream to Amazon Kinesis**\.

1. Under **Choose a stream type**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Send events to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream** – Choose this option if you want to send Amazon Pinpoint event data to an external application for analysis\.
   + **Send events to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream** – Choose this option if you want to send event data to an AWS data store, such as Amazon Redshift\.

1. For **Amazon Kinesis stream**, choose the Amazon Kinesis stream that you want to use to export the data\.
**Note**  
If you haven't already created an Amazon Kinesis stream, go to the Amazon Kinesis console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kinesis](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis)\. For more information about creating streams, see the [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/) or the [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/)\.

1. Under **IAM role**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Use an existing role** – Choose this option to have Amazon Pinpoint assume an IAM role that already exists in your account\. The role that you select must allow the `firehose:PutRecordBatch` action\. For an example of a policy that allows this action, see [Permissions Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-streams.html#permissions-streams-permissionspolicies) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.
   + **Automatically create a role** – Choose this option to automatically create an IAM role with the required permissions\. This role authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to send data to the stream that you chose in step 7\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

As Amazon Pinpoint receives events for your project, it sends this data to your Kinesis stream\. For information about the data that Amazon Pinpoint sends for an event, see [Streaming Amazon Pinpoint Events to Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/event-streams.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.
