# Inbox placement tests<a name="channels-email-deliverability-dashboard-pipt"></a>

On the **Inbox placement tests** page of the Deliverability dashboard, you can perform tests that can help you predict how specific messages are handled by over 95 major email providers around the world\. When you perform an inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers\. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses on several major email domains\. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can view the results\.

**Important**  
When you perform an inbox placement test, we send your message to a third party for delivery testing and analysis\. We impose our standard security requirements on this third party, and the contents of your emails are encrypted during transfer\. However, because it isn't necessary to use real data when you perform these tests, we recommend that you avoid sending sensitive, confidential, or personally identifiable information in the messages that you use in these tests\.

Inbox placement tests show you how different email providers handle specific messages\. The test results tell you how many of your messages arrived in test recipients' inboxes on the various email providers\. It also tells you how many messages were sent to recipients' junk mail folders, and how many weren't delivered at all\. Performing inbox placement tests help you identify deliverability problems that could arise as a result of the content of your email\.

Your monthly Deliverability dashboard subscription includes 25 inbox placement tests per month\. You can purchase more tests for an additional fee\. For more information, see [Amazon Pinpoint pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/pricing/)\.
