# Step 3: Write the message<a name="campaigns-message"></a>

After you specify the target segment for the campaign, you can write the message for the campaign\. 

If you set up the campaign as a standard campaign, you write a single message\. If you set up the campaign as an A/B test campaign, you define two or more *treatments*\. A *treatment* is a variation of your message that the campaign sends to different portions of the segment\.

**Prerequisite**  
Before you begin, complete [Step 2: Specify the audience for the campaign](campaigns-segment.md)\.

## Set up the campaign<a name="campaigns-message-channel"></a>

1. If you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign \(as opposed to a standard campaign\), specify the percentage of segment members who should receive each treatment\. An A/B test campaign can include up to five treatments\. Choose **Add another treatment** to add additional treatments\.

1. On the **Create your message** page, configure the message for the campaign\. The message options vary depending on the channel that you chose for the campaign\.

   If you're creating an email campaign, see [Writing an email message](#campaigns-message-email)\.

   If you're creating an SMS campaign, see [Writing an SMS message](#campaigns-message-sms)\.

   If you're creating a push notification campaign, see [Writing a push notification](#campaigns-message-mobile)\.

   If you're creating a campaign that sends messages through a custom channel, see [Configuring a custom channel message](#campaigns-message-custom)\.

### Writing an email message<a name="campaigns-message-email"></a>

   + To create a message that's based on an email template:

     1. Select **Choose an existing email template**, and then select **Choose a template**\.

     1. Browse for the template that you want to use\. When you select a template from the list, Amazon Pinpoint displays a preview of the active version of the template\. \(The active version is usually the version of a template that's been reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow\.\)

     1. When you find the template that you want, select it, and then select **Choose template**\.

     1. Under **Template version**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to automatically update the message to include any changes that you might make to the template before the message is sent\. To learn more about these options, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.

     1. When you finish choosing template options for the message, skip to step 5\.

1. For **Subject**, enter the subject line for your email message\.

1. For **Message**, enter the email body\.
**Tip**  
You can enter the email body by using either HTML or Design view\. In HTML view, you can manually enter HTML content for the email body, including features such as formatting and links\. In Design view, you can use a rich text editor with a formatting toolbar to apply formatting features such as links\. To switch views, choose **HTML** or **Design** from the view selector above the message editor\.

   

1. \(Optional\) In the field below the message editor, enter the content that you want to display in the body of messages that are sent to recipients whose email applications don't display HTML\.

1. If you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign \(as opposed to a standard campaign\), repeat the steps in this section for each treatment\. You can switch between treatments by using the tabs at the top of the **Email details** section\.

1. For **Sender email address**, choose the verified email address used to set up the email channel\.

### Writing an SMS message<a name="campaigns-message-sms"></a>

This section contains information about writing an SMS message\. 

1. On the **Create your message** page, do one of the following:
   + To design and write a new message for the campaign, select **Create a new SMS message**\.
   + To create a message that's based on an SMS template:

     1. Select **Choose an existing SMS template**, and then select **Choose a template**\.

     1. Browse for the template that you want to use\. When you select a template from the list, Amazon Pinpoint displays a preview of the active version of the template\. \(The active version is typically the version of a template that's been reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow\.\)

     1. When you find the template that you want, select it, and then select **Choose template**\.

     1. Under **Template version**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to automatically update the message to include any changes that you might make to the template before the message is sent\. To learn more about these options, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.

     1. When you finish choosing template options for the message, skip to step 5\.

1. For **Message type**, choose one of the following:
   + **Promotional** – Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages\. If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint optimizes delivery of the message to incur the lowest cost\.
   + **Transactional** – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one\-time passwords for multi\-factor authentication\. If you choose this option, Amazon Pinpoint optimizes delivery of the message to achieve the highest reliability\.

   This campaign\-level setting overrides your default message type, which you set on the SMS settings page for the project\.

1. \(Optional\) For the **Origination phone number**, choose the number to use as the originator\. The originator can be any of your numbers: short code, 10DLC, or long code/toll\-free\. If you have multiple numbers associated with your account, and you do not choose an originator, Amazon Pinpoint will choose an originator for you based on the following order: short code, 10DLC, long code/toll\-free\. 

1. For **Message**, type the message body\. The message can have up to 160 characters\.

   

1. Depending on which environment you're in, you can do one of the following:
   + **In the SMS sandbox environment** – Choose the verified destination numbers that you want to send messages to\. If the number you want isn't shown, add that number and then verify it\. For more information, see [Amazon Pinpoint SMS sandbox](channels-sms-sandbox.md)\.
   + **\(Optional\) In a production environment** – For **Sender ID**, enter a custom ID of up to 11 alphanumeric characters, including at least one letter, and no spaces\. The sender ID displays as the message sender on the recipient's device\. For example, you can use your business brand to make the message source easier to recognize\. Support for sender IDs varies by country or region\. For more information, see [Supported countries and regions \(SMS channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\.

     This message\-level sender ID overrides your default sender ID, which you set on the SMS settings page for the project\.

   

1. If you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign \(as opposed to a standard campaign\), repeat the steps in this section for each treatment\. You can switch between treatments by using the tabs at the top of the **SMS details** section\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

### Writing a push notification<a name="campaigns-message-mobile"></a>

This section contains information about writing a push notification and setting up the action that occurs when a recipient taps the notification\.

1. On the **Create your message** page, do one of the following:
   + To design and write a new message for the campaign, select **Create a new push notification**\.
   + To create a message that's based on a push notification template: 

     1. Select **Choose an existing push notification template**, and then select **Choose a template**\.

     1. Browse for the template that you want to use\. When you select a template from the list, Amazon Pinpoint displays a preview of the active version of the template\. \(The active version is typically the version of a template that's been reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow\.\)

     1. When you find the template that you want, select it, and then select **Choose template**\.

     1. Under **Template version**, specify whether you want Amazon Pinpoint to automatically update the message to include any changes that you might make to the template before the message is sent\. To learn more about these options, see [Managing versions of message templates](message-templates-versioning.md)\.

     1. If you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign \(as opposed to a standard campaign\), repeat the steps in this section for each treatment\. You can switch between treatments by using the tabs at the top of the **Push notification details** section\.

     1. When you finish, choose **Next**\.

1. For **Notification type**, specify the type of message that you want to send:
   + **Standard notification** – A push notification that has a title, a message body, and other content and settings\. Recipients are alerted by their mobile devices when they receive the message\.
   + **Silent notification** – A custom JSON attribute\-value pair that Amazon Pinpoint sends to your app without producing notifications on recipients' devices\. Use silent notifications to send data that your app is designed to receive and handle\. For example, you can use silent notifications to update the app's configuration or to show messages in an in\-app message center\.
   + **Raw message** – A push notification that specifies all of a notification's content and settings as a JSON object\. Use raw messages for cases such as sending custom data to an app for processing by that app, instead of the push notification service\.

     If you choose the **Raw message** option, the message editor displays an outline of the code to use for the message\. In the message editor, enter the content and settings that you want to use for each push notification service, including any optional settings—such as images, sounds, and actions—that you want to specify\. For more information, see the documentation for the push notification services that you use\. After you enter all the raw message content, repeat this step for each treatment, if you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign\. When you finish, choose **Next**\.

#### To create a standard notification<a name="campaigns-message-mobile-standard"></a>

**To create a standard notification**

1. For **Title**, enter the title that you want to display above the message\.

1. For **Body**, enter the message body\. Your push notification can have up to 200 characters\. A character counter below the field counts down from 200 as you add characters to the message\.

1. For **Action**, select the action that you want to occur when a recipient taps the notification:
   + **Open your app** – Your app launches, or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background\.
   + **Go to a URL** – The default mobile browser on the recipient's device launches and opens a web page at the URL that you specify\. For example, this action can be useful for sending users to a blog post\.
   + **Open a deep link** – Your app opens to a specific page or component in the app\. For example, this action can be useful to direct users to special promotions for in\-app purchases\.

1. \(Optional\) Under **Media URLs**, enter the URLs for any media files that you want to display in the push notification\. The URLs must be publicly accessible so that the push notification services for Android or iOS can retrieve the images\.

1. If you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign \(as opposed to a standard campaign\), repeat the steps in this section for each treatment\. You can switch between treatments by using the tabs at the top of the **Push notification details** section\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

#### To create a silent notification<a name="campaigns-message-mobile-silent"></a>

**To create a silent notification**

1. For **Message**, enter the content of the message in JSON format\. The exact content of the message varies depending on the notification service that you use and the values that your app expects to receive\.

1. If you created this campaign as an A/B test campaign \(as opposed to a standard campaign\), repeat the steps in this section for each treatment\. You can switch between treatments by using the tabs at the top of the **Push notification details** section\.

1. Choose **Next**\.



### Configuring a custom channel message<a name="campaigns-message-custom"></a>

This section contains information about configuring a campaign to send messages by using a custom channel\. You can use custom channels to send messages to your customers through any service that has an API or web hook functionality, including third\-party services\.

#### Sending a custom message using a Lambda function<a name="campaigns-message-custom-lambda"></a>

To send messages through a service that has an API, you have to create an AWS Lambda function that calls the API\. For more information about creating these functions, see [Creating custom channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/channels-custom.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

**To configure a custom channel that uses a Lambda function to call an API**

1. On the **Create your message** page, for **Choose your custom message channel type**, choose **Lambda function**\.

1. For **Lambda function**, choose the name of the Lambda function that you want to execute when the campaign runs\.

1. For **Endpoint options**, choose the endpoint types that you want Amazon Pinpoint to send to the Lambda function or webhook that's associated with the custom channel\.

    For example, if the segment you chose for this campaign contains several endpoint types, but you only want to send the campaign to endpoints that have the Custom endpoint type attribute, choose **Custom**\. You aren't required to choose the Custom endpoint type\. For example, you could choose to only send the custom channel campaign to endpoints with the Email endpoint type attribute\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

#### Sending a custom message using a webhook<a name="campaigns-message-custom-webhook"></a>

You can also create custom channels that send information about your segment members to services that use webhooks\.

**To configure a custom channel that uses webhooks**

1. On the **Create your message** page, for **Choose your custom message channel type**, choose **URL**\.

1. For **Enter your custom message channel URL**, enter the URL of the webhook\.

   The URL that you specify has to begin with "https://"\. It can only contain alphanumeric characters, plus the following symbols: hyphen \(\-\), period \(\.\), underscore \(\_\), tilde \(\~\), question mark \(?\), slash or solidus \(/\), pound or hash sign \(\#\), and semicolon \(:\)\. The URL has to comply with [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)\.

1. For **Endpoint options**, choose the endpoint types that you want Amazon Pinpoint to send to the Lambda function\. For example, if the segment you chose for this campaign contains several endpoint types, but you only want to send the campaign to endpoints that have the "Custom" endpoint type attribute, choose **Custom**\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

## Use message variables<a name="campaigns-message-variables"></a>

To create a message that's personalized for each recipient, use message variables\. Message variables refer to specific user attributes\. These attributes can include characteristics that you create and store for users, such as the user's name, city, device, or operating system\. When Amazon Pinpoint sends the message, it replaces the variables with the corresponding attribute values for the recipient\. For information about the attributes that you can use, see [Endpoint properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-endpoints-endpoint-id.html#apps-application-id-endpoints-endpoint-id-properties) in the *Amazon Pinpoint API Reference*\.

To include a variable in your message, add the name of an existing attribute to the message\. Enclose the name in two sets of curly braces, and use the exact capitalization of the name—for example, `{{Demographic.AppVersion}}`\.

Often, the most useful attributes for message variables are custom attributes that you create and store for users\. By using custom attributes and variables, you can send personalized messages that are unique for each recipient\.

For example, if your app is a fitness app for runners and it includes custom attributes for each user's first name, preferred activity, and personal record, you could use variables in the following message:

`Hey {{User.UserAttributes.FirstName}}, congratulations on your new {{User.UserAttributes.Activity}} record of {{User.UserAttributes.PersonalRecord}}!`

When Amazon Pinpoint sends this message, the content varies for each recipient after the variables are replaced\. Possible final messages are:

`Hi Jane Doe, congratulations on your new half marathon record of 1:42:17!`

Or:

`Hi John Doe, congratulations on your new 5K record of 20:52!`

## Test the message<a name="campaigns-message-test"></a>

Amazon Pinpoint can display a preview of an email message that you can view before you schedule the message to be sent\. For email and other types of messages, you can also send a test message to a small group of recipients for testing purposes\. You can send test messages for any type of message—email, push notification, SMS, or voice\.

### Previewing an email message without sending it<a name="campaigns-message-test-preview"></a>

The Design view in the Amazon Pinpoint message editor shows a preview of an email message as it would appear if it was rendered by your web browser\.

If you're working in HTML view, instead of Design view, you can display a preview of an email message next to the HTML content of the message\. This feature is helpful when you want to verify that a message renders as you expect, before you send a test\. 

Note that this preview only shows how the message would appear if it was rendered by your web browser\. As a best practice, you should still send test emails to several recipients and view those test messages by using a variety of devices and email clients\.

**To preview an email**

1. In the area above the HTML view of the message editor, choose **No preview**, and then choose **Preview**\. Amazon Pinpoint displays a preview pane next to the HTML editor\.

1. \(Optional\) To display the HTML content and the preview in a larger window, choose **Fullscreen** in the area above the message editor\.

### Sending a test message<a name="campaigns-message-test-send"></a>

It's often helpful to send a test message to actual recipients in order to make sure that your message appears correctly when your customers receive it\. By sending a test version of a message, you can test incremental improvements to the content and appearance of your message without impacting the status of your campaign\.

When you send test messages, consider the following factors:
+ You're charged for sending test messages as if they were regular campaign messages\. For example, if you send 10,000 test emails in a month, you're charged $1\.00 \(USD\) for sending the test emails\. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon Pinpoint pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/pricing/)\.
+ Test messages count toward your account's sending quotas\. For example, if your account is authorized to send 10,000 emails per 24\-hour period, and you send 100 test emails, you can send up to 9,900 additional emails in the same 24\-hour period\.
+ When you send a test message to specific users, you can specify up to 10 addresses\. Use commas to separate multiple addresses\.
**Note**  
The word "address" \(as it's used in this section\) can refer to any of the following: an email address, a mobile phone number, an endpoint ID, or a device token\.
+ When you send a test SMS message to specific phone numbers, the numbers must be listed in E\.164 format\. That is, they must include a plus sign \(\+\), the country code without a leading zero, and the complete subscriber number, including area code—for example, \+12065550142\. E\.164\-formatted numbers shouldn't contain parentheses, periods, hyphens, or any symbols other than the plus sign\. E\.164 phone numbers can have a maximum of 15 digits\.
+ When you send a test push notification, the addresses must be either endpoint IDs or device tokens\.
+ When you send a test message to a segment, you can only choose one segment\. Additionally, you can only choose segments that contain 100 endpoints or fewer\.
+ When you send a test message to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint creates a campaign for that test\. The name of the campaign contains the word "test", followed by four random alphanumeric characters, followed by the name of the campaign\. These campaigns aren't counted toward the maximum number of active campaigns that your account can contain\. Amazon Pinpoint doesn't create a new campaign when you send a test message to specific recipients\.
+ Events that are associated with test messages are counted in the metrics for the parent campaign\. For example, the **Endpoint deliveries** chart on the **Campaigns** analytics page includes the number of test messages that were successfully delivered\.

There are two ways to send a test message\. You can send it to an existing segment or you can send it to a list of addresses that you specify\. The best method depends on your use case\. For example, if you have a regular group of people who test your messages, you might find it helpful to create a segment that contains all of their endpoints\. If you need to send test messages to a group of testers that changes regularly, or to a dynamically generated address, you might find it easier to specify your recipients manually\.

**To send a test message to a segment**

1. Under the message editor, choose **Send a test message**\.

1. In the **Send a test message** dialog box, under **Send a test message to**, choose **A segment**\.

1. Use the drop\-down list to choose the segment that you want to send the test message to\.
**Note**  
Amazon Pinpoint automatically excludes all segments that contain 100 endpoints or more from this list\.

1. Choose **Send message**\.

**To send a test message to specific recipients**

1. Under the message editor, choose **Send a test message**\.

1. In the **Send a test message** dialog box, under **Send a test message to**, choose one of the options in the following table\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/campaigns-message.html)
