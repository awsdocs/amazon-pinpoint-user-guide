# Creating Funnel Charts with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="analytics-funnels"></a>

You can use Amazon Pinpoint to analyze *funnels*, which are charts that show how many users complete each of a series of steps\. For example, the series of steps in a funnel can be a conversion process that results in a purchase \(as in a shopping cart\), or some other intended user behavior\.

By monitoring funnels, you can assess whether conversion rates have improved because of changes to your app or because of an Amazon Pinpoint campaign\.

After you specify which steps belong in your funnel, the **Create a funnel** page displays a chart like the following example:

This example chart shows the percentage of users who completed each step in the process of updating an app\. By comparing the values between columns, you can determine the drop\-off rates between steps\. In this example, there is a 35 percent drop\-off between users who receive a notification and those who start an app session\. Then there is a 19 percent drop\-off between users who start a session and those who open the app settings page\.

To create a funnel, you specify each event that's part of the conversion process that you want to analyze\. When you add events to your funnel, you can choose any event that's reported by your app\. Your app can report the following types of events: 
+ Standard events – These include events that automatically report when an app session starts or stops\. The names of event types for standard events are denoted with an underscore prefix, as in `_session.start`\. Standard events also include monetization events that report in\-app purchases\.
+ Custom events – These are defined by you to monitor activities that are specific to your app\. Some examples are completing a level in a game, posting to social media, or setting particular app preferences\.
