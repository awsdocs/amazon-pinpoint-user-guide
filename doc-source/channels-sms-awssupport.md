# Requesting Support for SMS Messaging with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-sms-awssupport"></a>

Certain SMS options with Amazon Pinpoint are unavailable until you contact AWS Support\. Open a case in the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) to request any of the following:
+ 

**An increase to your monthly SMS spend threshold**  
By default, the monthly spend threshold is $1\.00 \(USD\)\. Your spend threshold determines the volume of messages that you can send with Amazon Pinpoint\. Request a spend threshold that meets the expected monthly message volume for your SMS use case\.
+ 

**A dedicated number \(short code or long code\)**  
Your dedicated origination number is assigned to your AWS account, and it's available exclusively to you\. If you don't have a dedicated number, Amazon Pinpoint assigns a number to your messages\. This number is shared with other Amazon Pinpoint users, and it varies based upon destination and message type \(transactional or promotional\)\. By reserving a short code or long code, you can send your messages with a persistent origination number\. This makes it easier for your audience to recognize that your organization is the source of your messages\. A dedicated long code or short code is required if you want to enable two\-way SMS with Amazon Pinpoint\. Long codes are supported only for two\-way SMS\.
+ 

**A dedicated sender ID**  
A *sender ID* is a custom ID that is shown as the sender on the recipient's device\. For example, you can use your business brand to make the message source easier to recognize\. Support for sender IDs varies by country or region\. For more information, see [Supported Countries and Regions \(SMS Channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\.

When you create your case in the AWS Support Center, include all the information that's required for the type of request you're submitting\. Otherwise, AWS Support contacts you to obtain this information before proceeding\. By submitting a detailed case, you help ensure that your case is fulfilled without delays\. For the details that are required for specific types of SMS requests, see the following topics\.
